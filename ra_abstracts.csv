Abstract
"In this study, we investigated the inhibitory effects of emodin on pyroptosis in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) synovial cells by modulating the HIF-1α/NLRP3 inflammasome pathway and mitochondrial autophagy. By employing a chemically induced hypoxia model with CoCl<sub>2</sub>, we established experimental groups including normal control, model group, and emodin-treated groups at different concentrations (5 μM, 10 μM, and 20 μM). We optimized the CoCl<sub>2</sub> concentration via CCK-8 assay to ensure cell viability. ELISA, Western blotting, transmission electron microscopy, and immunofluorescence were employed to assess HIF-1α, IL-1β, and IL-18 levels, pyroptosis-related proteins, autophagy markers, and NLRP3 fluorescence intensity. Statistical analysis revealed that increased CoCl<sub>2</sub> concentrations led to a significant cell viability reduction (<i>p</i> < 0.05), with 300 μM CoCl<sub>2</sub> causing ~50% inhibition at 24 h. Transmission electron microscopy confirmed autophagosome formation in emodin-treated groups, while Western blotting showed dose-dependent downregulation of HIF-1α, NLRP3, BNIP3, and related proteins. Immunofluorescence revealed reduced NLRP3 fluorescence intensity with increasing emodin doses (<i>p</i> < 0.05), alongside dose-dependent cell viability recovery (<i>p</i> < 0.05). Our findings demonstrate that emodin alleviates RA synovitis through dual mechanisms: inhibition of mitochondrial autophagy to regulate the balance between mitochondrial autophagy and pyroptosis, and suppression of HIF-1α/NLRP3-mediated pyroptosis signaling, thereby reducing IL-1β and IL-18 release and inhibiting synovial cell proliferation. This study provides innovative approaches for targeted RA therapy."
"The primary objective was to evaluate the additional benefits of contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) compared to unenhanced Doppler ultrasound (DUS) for the identification of active synovitis in rheumatoid arthritis (RA). We searched PubMed/MEDLINE and EMBASE (February 2024) for all English-written published reports of human studies including the use of CEUS for the study of synovitis in RA. The risk of bias of included studies was evaluated using the QUADAS tool. DUS and CEUS semiquantitative scores were transformed in binomial, and these data were extracted for meta-analysis. Results that we were unable to quantitatively aggregate were summarised qualitatively. Twenty-three studies using CEUS to evaluate 1117 joints from 827 subjects were included, of which 898 joints were from 669 RA patients. We performed a meta-analysis of 9 studies in active RA patients showing that from 474 joints evaluated by either PDUS/CDUS and CEUS, the synovitis detection was 49.2% and 83.8%, respectively, corresponding to a relative detection ratio (RDR) of 1.49 (95% CI 1.23-1.81) favouring CEUS. Heterogeneity of the data was moderate. In healthy subjects, CEUS detected no vascularisation in 4 studies. CEUS detects more microvascularisation than PDUS in active RA with an RDR of 1.49."
"Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is the most common inflammatory rheumatic disease, and it significantly increases the risk of cardiovascular disease and death. The evaluation of cardiovascular risk (CVR) is crucial in these patients, but it may be underestimated using the current criteria, as they do not include nontraditional CVR factors. Soluble ST-2, which is the circulating form of the IL-33 receptor, has been identified as a biomarker for cardiovascular and rheumatic diseases. In this study, we examined the role of sST-2 in assessing CVR in RA. Monocentric, retrospective, observational trial. Inclusion of RA patients on variable DMARD therapy. Analysis of RA disease using established scores (DAS 28, VAS, HFQ), clinical findings (number of swollen and painful joints), and laboratory investigation. Documentation of numerous CVR variables. Quantification of soluble sST-2 by ELISA. In total, 129 individuals were included. Soluble sST-2 did neither correlate nor was associated with any variable of RA disease activity. In contrast, significant associations were identified between sST-2 and a number of established CVR markers. The data indicates a novel role for sST-2 in CVR prediction in RA."

"Investigating the Mechanism of Gulao Yukang Pill (GLYK) in Treating Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA) via the Hippo signaling pathway and Its Regulatory Effects on Th17/Treg Cell Balance. Network pharmacology was applied to construct a network mapping the interactions between drug active ingredients and target genes, pinpointing the crucial active components and genetic targets through which GLYK exerts its effects on RA. Using Gene Set Variation Analysis (GSVA) in R4.2.2, we predicted the pathway activity scores of 7 Hippo pathways between the disease and control groups and selected those with significant differences. Key genes were correlated with the selected pathways, and target genes related to the Hippo pathway were screened. The binding capacity of crucial active components and their corresponding target genes was predicted using the Deep Purpose algorithm framework. Targets acting on RA were screened, and a CIA (Collagen-Induced Arthritis) animal model was developed for the purpose of further demonstrating the therapeutic impact of GLYK on RA and to verify the results of network pharmacology through histopathological observation, ELISA method detection, flow cytometry detection, Western blot detection, and qRT-PCR detection. Network pharmacology has identified nine key targets in the Hippo pathway associated with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) treatment, including Mst1 and TAZ, which are critical for GLYK's therapeutic effects as they are linked to its core effective ingredients that mediate the treatment of RA. Animal experiments validated the network pharmacology predictions, confirming that Mst1 and TAZ in the Hippo pathway are pivotal therapeutic targets for RA. GLYK suppresses inflammation and bone destruction by inhibiting the Hippo pathway components Mst1/TAZ, thereby reducing the Th17/Treg ratio. GLYK can influence the expression of upstream core molecules Mst1 and downstream effector molecules TAZ in the Hippo pathway, which can reduce the swelling and arthritis index of CIA rats, lower the proportion of Th17/Treg cells, inhibit inflammation, and bone destruction. The Hippo pathway is a goal of GLYK in the intervention of RA."
"Postoperative Candida albicans infections are exceedingly rare in urban populations, especially among patients on long-term immunosuppressive therapy. To date, there have been no reported cases of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients developing C albicans infections following spinal surgery. This report aims to highlight this rare occurrence and share insights on management strategies. A 53-year-old Han Chinese male patient was admitted with severe pain in the right lower limb. He had a 3-year history of RA and was on continuous antirheumatic medication. The postoperative course was complicated by the development of a C albicans infection, which was confirmed after multiple diagnostic measures. The patient was diagnosed with postoperative C albicans infection based on intraoperative sampling and laboratory confirmation 79 days after spinal surgery. The patient underwent targeted antifungal therapy, including an 8-week intravenous course followed by a 3-month oral itraconazole regimen. Supportive measures included meticulous perioperative management, nutritional support, and physical rehabilitation. The infection was successfully controlled, leading to the complete resolution of symptoms. The patient achieved a clinical cure, demonstrating the efficacy of combined antifungal therapy and comprehensive perioperative care. This case underscores the importance of vigilant perioperative management in RA patients, especially those with immunosuppression. Individualized treatment strategies, close monitoring of nutritional and functional status, and timely antifungal intervention are essential for preventing and managing such rare infections. Furthermore, a review of literature since 1980 has enhanced our understanding of risk factors, diagnosis, and treatment of postoperative C albicans infections, informing better clinical practice."
"Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic systemic autoimmune connective tissue disease characterized by joint swelling and pain, affecting multiple organs. Pulmonary hypertension (PH) is a known but relatively rare pulmonary vascular complication in RA patients. The pathophysiological mechanisms linking RA and PH are diverse, and Mendelian randomization analysis can be used to explore their correlation. A 43-year-old woman presented with swelling and pain in multiple joints of both hands and dyspnea on exertion lasting over 6 months. Laboratory tests showed elevated rheumatoid factor, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, C-reactive protein, and anticyclic citrullinated peptide antibody. Echocardiogram revealed PH and mild tricuspid regurgitation. Pulmonary computed tomography scan showed no signs of interstitial lung disease. Pulmonary function tests indicated severe reduction in diffusion capacity and alveolar volume. Right heart catheterization confirmed postcapillary PH with elevated mean pulmonary artery pressure and pulmonary vascular resistance. The patient received antirheumatic drugs combined with PH-targeted therapies for 4 months. At follow-up, the patient's pulmonary artery pressure returned to normal levels. The pathophysiology of RA-associated PH involves multiple inflammatory components. Accurate diagnosis requires right heart catheterization, pulmonary computed tomography, and pulmonary function testing. Combined antirheumatic and PH-targeted treatments can effectively reduce autoantibody levels and alleviate PH."
"The prevalence of autoimmune liver disease in Sjogren syndrome (SS) ranges from 1.7% to 47%. Hematologic involvement is commonly observed in SS patients, with 1.5% of patients presenting with monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS). Chronic antigenic stimulation of B lymphocytes in autoimmune diseases may eventually lead to clonal proliferation or MGUS. Nevertheless, studies reporting the concurrent manifestation of IgG4-related autoimmune hepatitis (IgG4-AIH), Primary biliary cholangitis (PBC), SS, and MGUS are scarce. This article reports a rare case involving the overlap of multiple autoimmune diseases. A middle-aged female patient experienced fatigue, anorexia, xerostomia, jaundice, and pruritus, as well as elevated levels of liver enzymes, globulin, and monoclonal immunoglobulin (M protein). Based on the findings of serum IgG4 levels, autoimmune serology, liver and labial gland biopsy, and bone marrow puncture, a diagnosis of IgG4-AIH, PBC, SS, and MGUS was made. The patient was initiated on oral prednisone 40 mg once daily and ursodeoxycholic acid capsules 250 mg 3 times daily. Upon stabilization of the condition, prednisone was progressively tapered to a maintenance dose of 5 mg daily. Over the 6-month follow-up period, favorable improvements were noted in the patient's symptoms. The purpose of this report's research is to thoroughly describe the clinical manifestations, diagnostic challenges, and treatment difficulties associated with the rare co-existence of multiple autoimmune diseases and hematological diseases, and to summarize the management methods. The significance of this study lies in emphasizing the importance of screening for autoimmune diseases and hematological diseases in patients presenting similar symptoms in clinical practice, aiming to provide a reference for clinicians in identifying and managing such complex cases, thereby enhancing the understanding and treatment level of these diseases."
"Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a progressive and systemic autoimmune disease, characterized by a chronic inflammatory process, affecting the lining of the synovial joints, many body organs/systems, and blood vessels. Its pathological hallmarks are hyperplasic synovium, bone erosion, and progressive joint destruction. Rheumatoid arthritis affects over 20 million people, with a worldwide prevalence of 0.5-1.0%, exhibiting gender, ethnic, and geographical differences. The progressive disability severely impairs physical motion and quality of life and is finally leading to a shortened life span. The pathogenesis of RA is a complex and still poorly understood process in which genetic and environmental factors are principally associated. Current treatment mostly relies on conventional/non-biological disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (cDMARDs), analgesics, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, glucocorticoids, steroids, immunosuppresants, and biologic DMARDs, which only control inflammation and pain. Along with side effects (drug toxicity and intolerance), these anti-rheumatic drugs possess limited efficacy. Therefore, the discovery of novel multi-target therapeutics with an improved safety profile that function as inhibitors of RA-linked signaling systems are in high demand, and this is in the interest of both patients and clinicians. Plant-derived extracts, nutritional supplements, dietary medicine, and molecules with anti-inflammatory activity represent promising adjuvant agents or alternatives for RA therapeutics. This review not only aims to discuss the basic features of RA pathogenesis, risk factors, and signaling pathways but also highlights the research progress in pre-clinical RA in in vitro and in vivo models, revealing new avenues in the management of the disease in terms of comprehensive multidisciplinary strategies originating from medicinal plants and plant-derived molecules."
"Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is one of the most representative autoimmune diseases. The peculiarity of this disease is synovial inflammation, which results in joint destruction and often disability. Although there are still several pathogenetic mechanisms to be clarified, lately, most studies have highlighted the involvement of mitochondria in the onset and progression of the disease. Mitochondrial functions are connected to many metabolic processes and the delivery of proinflammatory mediators. Mitochondria play a crucial role in the physiopathology of RA, contributing to chronic inflammation, cartilage and bone injury and chronic autoimmune response. Mitochondrial activity influences many aspects of the disease that will be discussed in terms of their correlation with the onset and persistence of RA, starting from mitochondrial dynamics up to bone homeostasis, passing through DAMPs and affecting immune cell functionality. Recent therapeutic approaches aim to improve mitochondrial function, reduce oxidative stress, modulate mitochondria-mediated inflammation and restore energy metabolism homeostasis."
"<b>Background</b>: Rheumatoid arthritis-related interstitial lung disease (RA-ILD) is a significant complication of RA which lacks effective treatments with high mortality. This study aimed to investigate the role of matrix metalloproteinase-7 (MMP-7) in mediating RA-ILD. <b>Methods</b>: Based on the database of RA-ILD patients, a bioinformatics analysis was performed. A protein-protein interaction (PPI) network focusing on MMP-7 was simulated. Pleural mesothelial cells (PMCs) were treated with RA-ILD patients' serum or RA-ILD-related inflammatory factors, and the protein expressions of collagen-I and MMP-7 were examined. An arthritis model was established using complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA). Changes in the weight and joints of mice were recorded, and lung tissues were evaluated by Masson staining and Sirius red stain techniques. MMP-7 inhibitor, MMP-7 siRNA and MMP shRNA lentivirus were used to inhibit MMP-7 and investigate changes in collagen-I and fibrosis in vivo and in vitro. <b>Results</b>: MMP-7 was found to be significantly expressed in RA-ILD lung tissue by bioinformatics analysis, and MMP-7 to maybe interact with collagen-I. In vitro experiments indicated cytokines IL-1β, IL-6 and TNF-α promoted MMP-7 and collagen-I expression in PMCs. Serum obtained from patients with RA-ILD also upregulated MMP-7 and collagen-I expression in PMCs. Inhibition of MMP-7 with MMP-7 siRNA or MMP inhibitor prevented collagen-I synthesis in PMCs. In vivo, CFA induced arthritis and subpleural lung inflammation in rats, but the MMP-7 inhibitor and MMP-7 siRNA attenuated CFA-induced lung inflammation and subpleural lung fibrosis. <b>Conclusions</b>: MMP-7 mediated subpleural lung inflammation as well as fibrosis in RA-ILD. It provided theoretical and experimental support for MMP-7 being a therapeutic target in RA-ILD."
"<b>Background/Objectives</b>: Degenerative arthritis is a chronic inflammatory disease marked by tissue degradation and vascular fibrosis. Macrophages play a central role in the inflammatory response by releasing mediators such as nitric oxide (NO), interleukin (IL)-6, tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α), and prostaglandin E2 (PGE2). This study aimed to investigate the anti-inflammatory potential of BTEX-K, a formulation of dried red ginseng combined with alpha-galactosidase, in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated cells. <b>Methods</b>: LPS-treated immune cells were used to assess the anti-inflammatory effects of BTEX-K. The levels of NO, IL-6, TNF-α, and PGE2 were measured following BTEX-K treatment. The protein expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) was evaluated. Cytotoxicity assays were conducted to determine whether the observed effects were due to cell viability loss. The involvement of MAPK signaling and NF-κB pathway modulation was examined by analyzing JNK phosphorylation, IκB degradation, and PPAR-γ expression. <b>Results</b>: BTEX-K significantly reduced the production of NO, IL-6, TNF-α, and PGE2 in LPS-treated cells without inducing cytotoxicity. The protein expression levels of iNOS and COX-2 were also suppressed. Furthermore, BTEX-K inhibited the LPS-induced phosphorylation of JNK in the MAPK pathway. It restored IκB levels and suppressed NF-κB activation by preventing the downregulation of PPAR-γ. <b>Conclusions</b>: BTEX-K demonstrates notable anti-inflammatory effects by inhibiting key inflammatory mediators and signaling pathways in immune cells. These findings support its therapeutic potential in mitigating inflammation-related symptoms, including pain, swelling, and redness, commonly seen in degenerative arthritis."
"By balancing immunity and tolerance, dendritic cells (DCs) are key regulators of immune responses. Recent studies have highlighted the crucial role of these cells in connective tissue diseases. Conventional DCs (cDCs) and plasmacytoid DCs (pDCs) exhibit distinct contributions to disease progression. In systemic lupus erythematosus and systemic sclerosis, pDCs primarily drive pathogenesis via excessive type I interferon production, whereas in rheumatoid arthritis (RA), cDCs play a major role in promoting autoreactive T cell activation. Emerging DC subsets, such as inflammatory DC3s and LAMP3<sup>+</sup> DCs, have been implicated in RA synovitis. In vasculitis, tissue-resident vascular DCs appear to regulate localized inflammation. Despite advances in single-cell analysis, the functional roles of specific DC subsets remain underexplored in several autoimmune conditions. Understanding DC heterogeneity and function in disease-specific contexts may lead to novel therapeutic strategies targeting DC-mediated immune dysregulation."
"Macrophages regulate inflammatory and fibrotic processes in several autoimmune and inflammatory rheumatic diseases. They are highly plastic cells, shifting within a range of pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory or pro-fibrotic phenotypes in response to dynamic interactions with other cells, environmental factors and cytokine signatures. The terms 'M1 macrophages', or classically activated, and 'M2 macrophages', or alternatively activated, were previously used to denote pro- and anti-inflammatory macrophage subsets, respectively, but this classification system has been outdated by in vivo evidence of a continuum of macrophage phenotypes that includes M1-like, M2-like and hybrid phenotypes. Deciphering the specific mechanisms that drive macrophage plasticity and function during the progression of rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, systemic sclerosis, systemic lupus erythematosus, and in synovitis and large vessel vasculitis in polymyalgia rheumatica and giant-cell arteritis, can improve our understanding of disease pathophysiology. Macrophage plasticity is enhanced in synovial tissue in rheumatoid arthritis, fibrotic skin and lung in systemic sclerosis, damaged kidney in systemic lupus erythematosus, and the bursal tissues or large vessels in polymyalgia rheumatica and giant-cell arteritis. Sophisticated transcriptomic analyses have revealed various phenotypic clusters of macrophages in biopsies of affected organs. Moreover, macrophage plasticity seems to be targeted by some standardized drugs used to treat the aforementioned conditions."
"Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is one of the most common inflammatory diseases in the world. Due to this importance, several drugs have been produced against effective targets in the pathogenesis of the disease. Considering various inflammatory pathways involved in RA, targeting each of these pathways alone cannot achieve sufficient improvement of the patients. Therefore, this study aimed to introduce safe natural product drug candidates screened in silico against several important protein targets (multi-targets) in the pathogenesis of RA. Tyrosine kinase 2 is a member of the Janus Kinase family, and due to its role in the signaling of numerous cytokines, its inhibition is considered an effective treatment option in inflammatory diseases. IL-6 is one of the most important innate immune cytokines that is secreted from activated macrophages in RA, and its level is directly related to the severity of joint destruction. Therefore, its inhibition plays an important role in improving the symptoms of RA. Also, the severity of the disease is directly related to the level of ACPA in the serum and synovial fluid of patients. Therefore, inhibiting its production by precluding the differentiation of B lymphocytes into plasma cells can improve the disease. In this study, after Virtual Screening, Molecular Docking, and Molecular Dynamics, we introduced Rutaecarpine, Hecogenin, Angustine, and Vomicine as new drug candidates for the treatment of RA. Rutaecarpine, Hecogenin, and Angustine inhibit all three targets with high affinity and stability, while Vomicine inhibits both TYK2 and IL-6 but not CD20. Future experimental studies can verify these findings."
"Previous evidence suggest bone and cartilage damage is the main pathogenesis of rheumatoid arthritis joint destruction. However, the role of meniscus usually has not been thoroughly explored. Here, we identify CD142<sup>+</sup> synovial fibroblasts as a subset located at sublining layer in normal and osteoarthritis synovium, which is increased and distributed at lining layer in rheumatoid arthritis synovium. Injection of CD142<sup>+</sup> fibroblasts into DBA/1 male mice's knee destructs meniscus but has slight effect on cartilage. ABCC4 is highly expressed in CD142<sup>+</sup> fibroblasts, whose blockage by MK571 attenuates CD142<sup>+</sup> fibroblasts-induced meniscus destruction through cAMP/PKA signaling. Long-term follow-up of rheumatoid arthritis cohort indicates that enriched CD142<sup>+</sup> fibroblasts at lining layer are a risk factor for severe knee joint destruction and eventually undergo total knee arthroplasty. Our results demonstrate CD142<sup>+</sup> fibroblasts as an indicator to assess prognosis and a therapeutic target to inhibit meniscal destruction, thereby alleviating rheumatoid arthritis knee joint damage."
"To examine the comparative risk of malignancy, venous thromboembolism (VTE), and heart failure (HF) associated with biologic/targeted synthetic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (b/ts DMARDs) in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). We conducted an observational cohort study using 3 US insurance claims databases: Medicare (2009-2019), MarketScan (2009-2020), and Optum's de-identified Clinformatics Data Mart Database (CDM, 2009-2022). We included adults with RA initiating abatacept (reference), tumor necrosis factor inhibitors (TNFi), rituximab, interleukin-6 inhibitors (IL-6i), or Janus kinase inhibitors (JAKi). We used an as-treated approach as the primary analysis to estimate outcome incidence. Inverse probability of treatment weighting was applied to adjust for confounding. Database-specific hazard ratios (HR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) were estimated using Cox-proportional hazard models, then combined through random-effects meta-analysis. We identified 26 908 abatacept, 11 176 IL-6i, 115 437 TNFi, 14 045 JAKi, and 12 097 rituximab initiators. Weighted HR (95% CI) of malignancy was 0.73 (0.60-0.88) for IL-6i, 0.85 (0.60-1.19) for JAKi, 1.30 (1.14-1.49) for rituximab, and 0.93 (0.85-1.02) for TNFi, compared to abatacept. Weighted HR (95% CI) for VTE was 0.92 (0.62-1.35), 1.17 (0.73-1.86), 1.43 (1.50-1.95), and 1.16 (0.93-1.46), respectively. Weighted HR (95% CI) for HF was 1.00 (0.69-1.46), 1.24 (0.62-2.51), 1.52 (1.04-2.22), and 1.54 (1.22-1.94), respectively. We observed increased risks of malignancy, VTE, and HF among rituximab initiators; an increased risk of HF among TNFi initiators; and a lower risk of malignancy among IL-6i initiators, all compared to abatacept initiators. These findings should be interpreted with caution due to the potential influence of residual confounding."
"Rheumatological, immune-mediated diseases (RDs) impose a substantial global burden, especially on women of working age, resulting in chronic disability and escalating healthcare utilisation. Despite therapeutic advances, the incidence of RDs is rising, and no definitive cure exists. Emerging evidence highlights the potential of early-stage interventions, such as addressing preclinical phases of diseases to delay or prevent disease onset. Modifiable risk factors, such as tobacco use, obesity, diet, infections, mechanical strain, and other environmental exposures (e.g., air pollution and ultraviolet radiation), offer clear targets for intervention. Despite increasing efforts in producing high-quality studies for each rheumatological condition, current evidence supports the global promotion of a healthy lifestyle with a balanced diet, regular physical activity and vaccinations, vitamin D supplementation, and minimisation of excessive infectious, mechanical and psychosocial strain. However, to stimulate stakeholders and policymakers in investing and developing strategies for primary prevention, further interventional trials are warranted on at-risk populations such as first-degree relatives of rheumatological patients and asymptomatic autoantibody carriers. Indeed, besides encouraging experiments in rheumatoid arthritis and psoriatic arthritis, where research has reached the adolescent stage, research in disease interception is still in its infancy for most rheumatological conditions."
"Targeting retinoic acid-related orphan receptor γ (RORγ) with inverse agonists presents a promising therapeutic strategy for treating autoimmune diseases, including psoriasis, rheumatoid arthritis, and multiple sclerosis. Through structure-based virtual screening, we identified a lupane-type pentacyclic triterpenoid, (2Z)-2-(2-furanylmethylene)-3-oxolup-20(29)-en-28-oic acid (<b>15</b>), as a new inverse agonist of RORγ. The compound exhibited IC<sub>50</sub> values of 0.4 μM and 0.9 μM in Gal4-RORγ and full-length RORγ luciferase assays, respectively. Compound <b>15</b> showed improved potency and efficacy compared to a structurally related known inverse agonist, betulinic acid. Among the four additional analogues tested (<b>15.1</b>-<b>15.4</b>), two (<b>15.2</b> and <b>15.3</b>) also demonstrated RORγ inverse agonist activity with low micromolar IC<sub>50</sub> values in Gal4-RORγ luciferase assay. Real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction experiments confirmed that compounds <b>15</b>, <b>15.2</b>, and <b>15.3</b> downregulated RORγ target genes. Thermal shift assays showed that both betulinic acid and <b>15</b> stabilized the RORγ ligand-binding domain. Molecular docking and structure-activity relationship analysis revealed distinct binding modes within the RORγ ligand-binding domains, further supported by site-directed mutagenesis. These findings expand the repertoire of RORγ inverse agonists based on the pentacyclic triterpenoid scaffolds."
"ReFLECT was a French multicenter, observational cohort study evaluating the effectiveness and safety of CT-P13, an infliximab (IFX) biosimilar, in a real-world setting. Here, we describe the results for patients with rheumatic disease. Eligible patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA), ankylosing spondylitis (AS), or psoriatic arthritis (PsA) were recruited and received intravenous CT-P13 induction and/or maintenance therapy. Patients were either naive to IFX (IFX-naive) or had been previously treated with IFX originator or another IFX biosimilar (IFX-switched). CT-P13 persistence (primary objective) was measured as a time-dependent variable during a 2-year follow-up period. Safety was also assessed. The patient population comprised 142 patients with RA (IFX-naive: n = 70; IFX-switched: n = 69; other [i.e., previously received IFX, but received another treatment before switching to CT-P13]: n = 3); 411 patients with AS (IFX-naive: n = 189; IFX-switched; n = 201; other: n = 21); and 96 patients with PsA (IFX-naive: n = 44; IFX-switched: n = 47; other: n = 5). After 2 years of follow-up, CT-P13 persistence rates were 49.6% (95% confidence interval [CI] 40.4-60.8%), 62.7% (95% CI 56.6-69.5%), and 73.0% (95% CI 62.7-85.1%) in patients with RA, AS, and PsA, respectively. CT-P13 persistence was greater for IFX-switched than IFX-naive groups in patients with RA (65.4% [95% CI 52.8-81.0%] vs. 33.3% [22.7-49.1%]) and AS (66.5% [95% CI 58.3-76.0%] vs. 56.6% [47.6-67.4%]) and was similar between IFX-switched and IFX-naive groups in patients with PsA (75.9% [95% CI 62.2-92.8%] vs. 72.0% [57.5-90.1%]). The main reason for CT-P13 discontinuation was loss of response (RA/AS/PsA) in both IFX-naive (38.6%/23.3%/22.7%) and IFX-switched 18.8%/18.4%/12.8%) groups. Among patients (RA, AS, and PsA), 52.1%, 57.9%, and 56.3%, respectively, reported ≥ 1 adverse event (AE), and 14.1%, 11.4%, and 10.4%, respectively, reported serious AEs. After 2 years of follow-up, the effectiveness of intravenous CT-P13 was maintained in > 65% of IFX-switched patients and CT-P13 induced effective therapeutic maintenance in IFX-naive patients. CT-P13 had an acceptable safety profile. ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT02925338."
"Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is linked to systemic inflammation and immune dysregulation. The neutrophil-percentage-to-albumin ratio (NPAR), integrating neutrophil activity and nutritional status, may reflect inflammatory and immune responses. However, its association with RA remains unexplored. We aimed to investigate the relationship between NPAR and RA using data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 1999-2018. This cross-sectional study utilized data from NHANES including 38,272 participants. The NPAR was calculated based on the neutrophil percentage (in total WBC count) (%), and albumin value (g/dL). We employed weighted multivariable logistic regression analysis and subgroup analysis to examine the association between NPAR and RA, adjusting for sociodemographic, lifestyle, and clinical covariates. Restricted cubic splines were used to assess potential non-linear relationships. Additionally, receiver operating characteristic (ROC) was performed to determine the predictive accuracy of NPAR compared with other inflammatory markers. After adjusting for all covariates, multivariable logistic regression indicated that elevated levels of NPAR were significantly associated with an increased risk of RA (OR<sub>tertile3vs1</sub> = 1.27, 95% CI: 1.11-1.44). A nonlinear, reverse L-shaped relationship was observed, with RA risk rising significantly when NPAR exceeded 13.6 (<i>P</i> <sub>non-linearity</sub> = 0.004). Subgroup analyses confirmed consistency across populations. NPAR demonstrates a superior predictive capability for RA risk when compared to other established markers, including Systemic Immune-Inflammation Index (SII), Systemic Inflammation Response Index (SIRI), Platelet-to-Lymphocyte Ratio (PLR), Monocyte-to-Lymphocyte Ratio (MLR), and Neutrophil-to-Lymphocyte Ratio (NLR). Overall, our study demonstrates a significant positive association between NPAR and RA prevalence in U.S. adults, particularly when NPAR levels exceeded 13.6. Our findings underscore the critical role of immune-nutritional interactions in RA pathogenesis. However, owing to the cross-sectional design, prospective longitudinal investigations are warranted to establish causality and elucidate underlying biological mechanisms."
"RNA-binding proteins (RBP) are important for the initiation and resolution of inflammation, so better understanding of RBP-RNA interactions and their crosstalk with metabolism may provide alternate targets to controlling inflammation. Here we establish global RNA-protein interactome purification (GRPIp) to profile the RBP landscape in inflammatory primary macrophages and identify ribosomal RNA processing 1 (RRP1) as a suppressor of inflammatory innate responses. Mechanistically, RRP1 binds nuclear thymidylate synthetase (Tyms) transcript and decreases TYMS expression post-transcriptionally in inflammatory macrophages, consequently suppressing folate metabolism cycle and inhibiting one-carbon metabolism-driven inflammation. Myeloid-specific RRP1-deficient mice develop severe experimental arthritis with increased pro-inflammatory cytokines and immunologic injury. Meanwhile, in patients with rheumatoid arthritis, RRP1 expression in peripheral blood monocytes negatively correlates with TYMS expression and serum IL-1β levels. Our results thus suggest that RRP1 acts as an anti-inflammatory factor through braking one-carbon metabolism post-transcriptionally, thereby implicating potential strategies for controlling autoinflammation."
"Peptidylarginine deiminase isoform 4 (PADI4) is a potential therapeutic target for treatment of rheumatoid arthritis. Auto-antibodies induced by the dysregulated catalysis of peptidylarginine into peptidylcitrulline by PADI4 can cause the onset and progression of rheumatoid arthritis. Herein, we report a novel class of spiro[chromene-2,2'-indoline] derivatives which were synthesized and optimized from a hit discovered by screening two libraries with 3760-members of natural products and derivatives for PADI4 inhibitors. In vitro, our derivatives were proved capable of potently inhibiting PADI4 and diminishing cellular citrullination; in vivo, the representative compound 7, 6,8-dimethoxy-1',3',3'-trimethylspiro[chromene-2,2'-indoline], effectively ameliorated the severity and pathologic progress of collagen type II antibody/LPS induced rheumatoid arthritis in a mouse model. This work establishes compound 7 and the related potent compounds worthy of further study and development to treat rheumatoid arthritis, and validates PADI4 as a therapeutic target for this purpose."
"Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a severe and chronic inflammatory disease that currently has almost no cure. Here, we report a natural small molecule bergapten (BG) as a promising treatment for RA. Firstly, our results show BG treatment significantly inhibits RA in collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) rats. Then, through single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) analysis of synovium tissue of CIA rats, we find that the proportion of inflammation-related cells, including fibroblast-like synoviocytes (FLSs) and macrophages, are significantly reduced following BG treatment. Additionally, BG markedly blocks the interaction between macrophages and FLSs, which further decreases the inflammation in synovium tissue of CIA rats. Mechanistically, BG exerts its anti-inflammatory effects, at least partially, by binding to STAT3, a key regulator of inflammation, thereby inhibiting STAT3 phosphorylation and activation, which leads to the suppression of the STAT3 signaling pathway in both macrophages and FLSs. Our study provides a promising drug candidate for the treatment of RA and also suggests the potential of BG in treating other diseases linked to dysregulated STAT3."
"The variability in treatment response in people with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) warrants the prediction of patients at high risk of treatment failure. Identification of biomarkers linked to clinical remission in RA is currently a challenge. Metabolomics may help to identify such biomarkers as it allows for a comprehensive exploration of disease-related variations that extends beyond the genome and proteome. This hypothesis-free exploratory metabolomics study aimed to profile serum metabolic alterations in early RA to understand the metabolic changes associated with disease activity and therapeutic response. The study included 220 early RA participants from the NORD-STAR study, randomized at baseline into four arms, ranging from conventional anti-rheumatic treatment to biological drugs: methotrexate combined with prednisolone (1), certolizumab (2), abatacept (3), or tocilizumab (4). Untargeted metabolomics was performed in serum samples at baseline and 24-week follow-up. Participants achieving clinical disease activity index remission at 24 weeks were defined as responders. Machine learning models for treatment response were constructed using random forest, logistic regression, support vector machine and extreme gradient boosting algorithms based on selected features. We identified 278 metabolites, of which 39 were associated with baseline disease activity, including several acylcarnitines and amino acids. We also found 17 baseline metabolites associated with remission at 24 weeks in the overall cohort, including malic acid (β=-0.4), cytidine (β = 0.4), arginine (β = 0.3), and citrulline (β = 0.2), as well as specific metabolites and metabolic pathways associated with remission in the four treatment arms. Fifteen features were identified using machine learning-based multivariable selection. The best predictive model using logistic regression achieved AUC of 0.75 in training and 0.73 in the test set. Our study has identified several baseline metabolites and metabolic pathways associated with disease activity and response to different treatments in early RA. By integrating metabolomics and clinical data, we developed predictive models for response to treatment in early RA, though their predictive performance remains limited."
"To (1) understand key physical activity (PA) determinants for individuals with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and (2) map determinants using the behavior change wheel (BCW) to guide theory-driven intervention development. A patient-centered nominal group technique (NGT) approach was used, with recruitment via purposive sampling from past research participants. After self-reporting demographics and PA, participants attended NGT sessions consisting of idea generation, sharing, and refinement via discussion. Researchers combined PA determinant lists across sessions using content analysis. Using a survey, participants rated the importance of each determinant from 1-9. Theoretical mapping was completed with the most important 2/3 of determinants using the BCW. Fourteen individuals participated across 3 sessions. Mean age was 58.1±13.4 years, 20.0±21.8 years with RA. Participants were 85.7% female, 78.6% white, and 85.7% had a university education. All participants were physically active, with a mean Leisure Score Index of 43.3±18.4 (<14 = insufficiently active, 14-24 = moderately active, >24 = active). The 22 PA barriers and 25 facilitators fell into 4 categories: personal, social, physical, and environmental. The top 3 barriers (importance: 7.1-7.4/9) were unpredictable fluctuations, fatigue, and lack of RA-specific PA knowledge. The top 3 facilitators (importance: 7.6-7.9/9) were motivation to maintain function, PA tailoring knowledge, and PA self-confidence. Theoretical mapping led to 3 capability-related, 6 opportunity-related, and 4 motivation-related determinants. Our study highlighted key PA determinants related to capability, opportunity, and motivation. Interventions may target skills (capability), social influences (opportunity), and beliefs about capabilities (motivation) to increase PA in RA."
"Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic autoimmune disease that has a serious impact on both human health and animal production. The gut microbiota is a large and complex symbiotic ecosystem in animals, and the imbalance of gut microbiota is closely related to the pathogenesis of numerous diseases, including RA. The interactions among the gut microbiota, intestinal barrier, and immune system play key roles in maintaining intestinal homeostasis and affecting the development of RA. Regulating intestinal flora and metabolites provides new ideas for the prevention and treatment of RA. Probiotics can regulate the balance of intestinal flora and metabolites, improve the immune environment, and provide novel therapeutic strategies against RA. In order to summarize the role of gut microbiota and metabolite remodeling in the development and management of RA, this review will elaborate on the role of intestinal flora imbalance in the pathogenesis of RA and assess prospective therapeutic approaches that target the gut flora. Understanding the interaction among intestinal flora, metabolites, and RA will help to clarify the pathogenesis of RA and develop innovative and personalized therapeutic interventions against chronic autoimmune diseases."
"This study investigated the effects of <i>Bothrops moojeni</i> (<i>B. moojeni</i>) venom and its high- (HMM) and low-molecular mass (LMM) fractions on human osteoclast (OC) differentiation and function in vitro, aiming to identify novel therapeutics for bone disorders. Venom preparations were applied at 5 µg/mL (crude venom and HMM) or 1 µg/mL (LMM) from day 4 of peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) differentiation through terminal OC formation, enabling evaluation across early differentiation, fusion, and maturation stages. RNA sequencing revealed 7793 genes common to all experimental groups, with unique gene expression signatures of 149 (control), 221 (HMM), 248 (crude venom), and 60 (LMM) genes, reflecting distinct molecular responses. The negative control PBMC group exhibited 1013 unique genes enriched in immune-related pathways, consistent with their undifferentiated state. Crude venom induced the broadest transcriptional modulation, upregulating key fusion (CD47) and resorption (CTSK) genes, and altering markers of OC differentiation. The HMM fraction predominantly influenced inflammatory and osteoclastogenic pathways, notably TNF and NF-κB signaling, while the LMM fraction selectively regulated fusion-related genes (e.g., CD44) and immune pathways, indicating targeted modulation of OC activity. Cytokine profiling showed that crude venom and HMM suppressed osteoclastogenic cytokines such as IL-1β and IL-6, supporting their potential use in inflammatory bone diseases. Pathway enrichment analyses confirmed these differential effects on immune response and bone resorption mechanisms. Together, these results demonstrate that <i>B. moojeni</i> venom and its fractions differentially impact OC biology, with crude venom exerting broad effects and HMM and LMM fractions offering more specific modulation. Future studies will isolate bioactive components and assess therapeutic efficacy in animal models of osteoporosis and rheumatoid arthritis."
"Osteoclasts, which are derived from myeloid precursors, are essential for physiologic bone remodeling but also mediate pathological bone loss in inflammatory diseases such as periodontitis and rheumatoid arthritis. Lysine-specific demethylase (LSD1/KDM1A) is a histone demethylase that modulates the chromatin landscape via demethylation of H3K4me1/2 and H3K9me1/2, thereby regulating the expression of genes essential for deciding cell fate. We previously demonstrated that myeloid-specific deletion of LSD1 (LSD1LysM-Cre) disrupts osteoclast differentiation, leading to enhanced BV/TV under physiological conditions. In this study, we show that LSD1LysM-Cre female mice are similarly resistant to inflammatory bone loss in both ligature-induced periodontitis and K/BxN serum-transfer arthritis models. Bulk RNA-seq of mandibular-derived preosteoclasts from LSD1LysM-Cre mice with ligature-induced periodontitis revealed the upregulation of genes involved in inflammation, lipid metabolism, and immune response. Notably, LSD1 deletion blocked osteoclastogenesis even under TGF-β and TNF co-stimulation, which is an alternative RANKL-independent differentiation pathway. Upregulation of <i>Nlrp3</i>, <i>Hif1α</i>, and <i>Acod1</i> in LSD1LysM-Cre preosteoclasts suggests that LSD1 is essential for repressing inflammatory and metabolic programs that otherwise hinder osteoclast commitment. These findings establish LSD1 as a critical epigenetic gatekeeper integrating inflammatory and metabolic signals to regulate osteoclast differentiation and bone resorption. Therapeutic inhibition of LSD1 may selectively mitigate inflammatory bone loss while preserving physiological bone remodeling."
"Tanshinones are a class of lipophilic diterpenoid quinones extracted from <i>Salvia miltiorrhiza</i> (Dan shen), a widely used herb in traditional Chinese medicine. These compounds, particularly tanshinone IIA (T-IIA) and sodium tanshinone sulfonate (STS), have been acknowledged for their broad spectrum of biological activities, including anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, anti-tumor, antiresorptive, and antimicrobial effects. Recent studies have highlighted the potential of tanshinones in the treatment of osteolytic diseases, characterized by excessive bone resorption, such as osteoporosis, rheumatoid arthritis, and periodontitis. The therapeutic effects of tanshinones in these diseases are primarily attributed to their ability to inhibit osteoclast differentiation and activity, suppress inflammatory cytokine production (e.g., tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α), interleukin (IL)-1β, and IL-6), and modulate critical signaling pathways, including NF-kB, MAPK, PI3K/Akt, and the RANKL/RANK/OPG axis. Additionally, tanshinones promote osteoblast differentiation and mineralization by enhancing the expression of osteogenic markers such as Runx2, ALP, and OCN. Preclinical models have demonstrated that T-IIA and STS can significantly reduce bone destruction and inflammatory cell infiltration in arthritic joints and periodontal tissues while also enhancing bone microarchitecture in osteoporotic conditions. This review aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the pharmacological actions of tanshinones in osteolytic diseases, summarizing current experimental findings, elucidating underlying molecular mechanisms, and discussing the challenges and future directions for their clinical application as novel therapeutic agents in bone-related disorders, especially periodontitis. Despite promising in vitro and in vivo findings, clinical evidence remains limited, and further investigations are necessary to validate the efficacy, safety, and pharmacokinetics of tanshinones in human populations."
"Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a debilitating autoimmune disease affecting approximately 1% of the global population and is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Given the known anti-inflammatory effects of cannabinoids, we investigated the therapeutic potential of a high-CBD extract, termed CBD-X, by assessing its effects on immune cells and disease progression. This study investigates the therapeutic potential of a high-CBD extract (CBD-X) in RA. We evaluated the effects of CBD-X on cells involved in RA pathogenesis using macrophages and primary human neutrophils as ex vivo models. In addition, two murine models of RA were applied: collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) and collagen antibody-induced arthritis (CAIA). Ex vivo experiments demonstrated that CBD-X inhibited the secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines, including IL-1β from macrophages and IL-8, IL-6, and TNF-α from human neutrophils, suggesting its potential to modulate inflammatory responses. Moreover, CBD-X attenuated NF-κB p65 and Akt phosphorylation downstream LPS-activation signal in neutrophils. To further evaluate its therapeutic effects, we employed two murine models of RA: collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) and collagen antibody-induced arthritis (CAIA). In both models, CBD-X treatment resulted in a significant reduction of leukocyte levels in the blood, primarily through the suppression of neutrophil and monocyte populations, which play a central role in RA pathogenesis. Additionally, CBD-X reduced neutrophil migration to the joints in the CAIA model, highlighting its potential to alleviate joint inflammation. Furthermore, it modulated the neutrophil-to-macrophage ratio (NMR), an important marker of RA progression, an effect that was not observed with dexamethasone treatment, suggesting a distinct mechanism of immune regulation. Notably, CBD-X promoted the pro-resolving macrophages to the rheumatic joints. Importantly, CBD-X exerted its anti-inflammatory effect by downregulating TNF-α and MCP-1 while upregulating IL-10, a key anti-inflammatory cytokine involved in immune homeostasis. These findings indicate that CBD-X has a significant potential as a therapeutic agent for RA, offering a promising approach to modulate immune responses and reduce inflammation in RA patients."
"Porphyromonas gingivalis is a major human oral opportunistic pathogen and a key etiological agent of periodontal disease, contributing to inflammation and bone loss in the oral cavity. Periodontitis is not limited to oral health complications; it has also been associated with a range of systemic conditions, including coronary heart disease (CAD), respiratory disease, rheumatoid arthritis, chronic kidney disease (CKD), and certain types of cancer. Immunization-based prevention of periodontitis appears to be a promising strategy; however, no vaccine is currently available for commercial use. In the present study, a novel vaccine candidate against P. gingivalis was proposed, consisting of a P. gingivalis protein, gingipain, glycosylated with the carbohydrate moiety of P. gingivalis lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Glycosylation of gingipain was achieved in Escherichia coli by introducing the Campylobacter jejuni N-glycosylation system, the P. gingivalis LPS biosynthetic pathway and the gingipain gene. The neoglycoprotein was purified using column chromatography to a purity exceeding 99%, yielding a soluble antigen. The modified protein was recognized by commercial antibodies targeting the protein backbone, the carbohydrate moiety, and a custom monoclonal antibody specific to the purified LPS of P. gingivalis American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) 33277. The glycoprotein was used to immunize mice, and the resulting sera were analyzed for their ability to opsonize bacterial cells. The absence of detectable opsonization suggests that the elicited antibodies are more likely directed against the protein component of the vaccine rather than the glycan surface antigen. The final product was most likely assembled correctly, as it was recognized by LPS-specific antibodies. Further evaluation in an animal model of induced periodontitis is necessary to determine whether the elicited antibodies can effectively inhibit gingipain released by the pathogen. If this vaccine candidate demonstrates protective efficacy, the approach could accelerate and enhance the safety of vaccine design against a wide range of other pathogens."
"To surpass challenges with traditional approaches to treat Rheumatoid arthritis (RA), an improved understanding of molecular-level pathogenesis brought forth targeted therapy with biologics as a great promise in halting the progression of RA. Novel biologics are being designed with the help of synthetic fusion proteins, monoclonal antibodies, and protein fragments, with or without drugs, to target various signaling pathways, including TNF-α, IL-6, JAK, Th-17, IL-family, GM-CSF, B-cell, and T-cell signaling. The journey of biologics in RA management began in 1998 with etanercept (Enbrel<sup>®</sup>). Since then, regulatory bodies have endorsed various biologics and many more are in different clinical stages. This review aims to explore RA by examining current clinical studies with focus on emerging development on molecular-level pathogenesis, prevalent conventional treatment options and their limitations, as well as recent advancements in biologically engineered therapeutics. It also includes a few relevant case studies to support these findings. Despite the progress, challenges remain, such as high costs and the need for safer, more effective delivery methods. The document also touches on the historical perspective of RA, its pathophysiology, and the role of synovial fluid pharmacokinetics in treatment effectiveness. The importance of early diagnosis and well-controlled treatment strategies for RA is paramount. The potential of emerging biological and targeted treatments to facilitate a treat-to-target approach in RA management is substantial. This review explores the key molecular pathways of rheumatoid arthritis and includes detailed figures for better understanding. It also highlights the promising potential of biologically engineered therapeutics, supported by evidence from case studies and clinical trials."
"The objective of this study is to compare the effectiveness of reference biologic medicines used in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) specifically adalimumab, etanercept, and infliximab, with corresponding biosimilar medicines, based on an exploratory analysis of clinical data obtained in patients treated with these medicines in five hospitals in the region of Catalonia, Spain. There is a consultation of the database of the Registry of Patients and Treatments of the Catalan Health Service: extraction of data from adult patients diagnosed with moderate and severe active RA and with active prescription of at least one biological drug (reference or biosimilar) or JAK inhibitor. To compare the effectiveness of each reference biologic with its biosimilar, differences in mean DAS28-ESR values before and after treatment were assessed for adalimumab and its biosimilar, etanercept and its biosimilar, and infliximab and its biosimilar. The study consisted of 643 patients. The most dispensed medicines were anti-TNFs, with 303 patients on treatment. Thirty-six percent of all patients were using biosimilars. No statistically significant differences were observed in any of the three comparisons between the reference biologic medicine and its biosimilar. These findings suggest that biosimilars have comparable effectiveness to reference biologics in reducing DAS28-ESR; in addition, they can provide substantial savings to public health systems. A significant number of patients diagnosed with moderate to severe active RA were treated with biological medicines and receiving the available biosimilar treatments. Future research should be conducted to confirm comparable effectiveness found to their reference biologic medicines in this exploratory analysis. Key Points • Biosimilar use: 36% of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients in Catalonia are treated with biosimilars, exceeding the 12% recommendation. This reflects growing acceptance of these alternatives. • Comparative effectiveness: Biosimilars of adalimumab, etanercept, and infliximab showed comparable therapeutic benefit to their reference biologics in reducing disease activity in active rheumatoid arthritis. • Real-world data: The study provides real-world data from five hospitals, making biosimilar medicines a viable choice for rheumatologists in routine rheumatoid arthritis management."
"Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) coexisting with gout is considered rare, with only few case studies reporting this coexistence. This study aimed to evaluate the association between RA and subsequent gout risk in South Korea, considering the serostatus (seropositive RA [SPRA], seronegative RA [SNRA]) and type of biologic/targeted synthetic disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (b/tsDMARDs). This nationwide, population-based cohort study analyzed 34,356 patients newly diagnosed with RA between 2010 and 2017 and 103,068 matched non-RA participants (1:3 ratio based on age and sex). The incident gout was defined according to the claims database diagnostic code for gout. RA patients had a 2.7-fold higher risk of developing gout than non-RA participants (95% confidence interval [CI]: 2.63-2.80). Patients with SPRA and SNRA had a higher risk of gout than non-RA participants, with an adjusted hazard ratio (aHR) of 2.79 and 2.56, respectively. The risk of gout was slightly higher in SPRA than in SNRA (aHR 1.07). RA patients using b/tsDMARDs had lower risk of gout (aHR, 1.93) than those not using these medications (aHR, 2.78). Contrary to common perceptions, both SPRA and SNRA were associated with a higher risk of gout, with slightly higher risk in SPRA than in SNRA. Using b/tsDMARDs may reduce the risk of gout in patients with RA."
"Austria, a country with a high standard of living and a well-developed healthcare system, still experiences socioeconomic status (SES) disparities that impact health outcomes. Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic autoimmune disease associated with significant disability and comorbidities. While SES has been linked to RA prevalence and disease severity, its role in a high-income country like Austria remains underexplored. This study investigates the association between SES factors-education, income, employment status and migration background-and RA prevalence and outcomes. This population-based study used data from the Paracelsus 10,000 cohort in Salzburg, Austria and a cross-sectional design. A total of 9,256 participants aged 40-77 years were analyzed, including 289 individuals diagnosed with RA based on the ACR/EULAR classification criteria. SES was assessed through self-reported education, income, employment status and country of birth. Logistic regression models were used to evaluate the association between SES and RA, adjusting for age, sex, metabolic syndrome, smoking and alcohol consumption. RA prevalence was significantly lower among individuals with higher education (OR = 0.55, 95% CI: 0.37-0.82 for medium education; OR = 0.41, 95% CI: 0.25-0.68 for high education). Lower household income correlated with higher RA prevalence. Employment disparities were evident, with RA patients exhibiting higher rates of unemployment and work disability. Despite Austria's high standard of living, SES remains a key determinant of RA prevalence. Lower levels of education, income and employment are associated with higher rates of RA, highlighting the need for targeted public health interventions. Strengthening healthcare access, promoting early screening and offering economic support to vulnerable groups could be important steps toward reducing these disparities. Further research should explore the underlying mechanisms of this association and examine whether socioeconomic disparities also influence disease progression and patient outcomes."
"Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is an incurable, disabling autoimmune disease, and combination therapy with disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs targeting different pathological mechanisms is a therapeutic strategy to improve treatment outcomes. Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) offers the advantage of multi-component, multi-target therapy for RA; however, its ability to simultaneously target multiple key pathological mechanisms of RA remains to be further investigated. Fuhu Lijie Tang (FHLJT) is a novel TCM formulation with potential therapeutic effects on RA, and its anti-arthritic mechanisms require systematic study. This study aimed to comprehensively investigate the anti-arthritic effects of FHLJT and its underlying molecular mechanisms, focusing on its potential to simultaneously target multiple key pathological mechanisms in the treatment of RA. Collagen II-induced arthritic (CIA) rats received FHLJT treatment, with therapeutic effects assessed through arthritis scoring, paw swelling measurement, inflammatory marker analysis, and histopathology. Synovial tissue transcriptomics identified differentially expressed genes, followed by validation through Western blot, immunohistochemistry, ELISA, and flow cytometry to validate these findings. FHLJT significantly reduced joint inflammation and histopathological damage in CIA rats. Transcriptomic analyses showed that FHLJT downregulated multiple RA-associated pathways, including RA signaling, T cell receptor (TCR), B cell receptor (BCR), vascular endothelial growth factor, osteoclast differentiation, antigen presentation, phagosome, and protein modification pathways. Further interaction analysis identified the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) - protein kinase B (Akt) and AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) signaling pathways as central to these processes. Experimental validation confirmed that FHLJT inhibited citrullinated proteins, peptidyl arginine deiminase 2 (PADI2), PADI4, interferon gamma inducible protein 30, and CD74 expression in joint tissues of CIA rats. It also suppressed phosphorylated zeta chain of T cell receptor associated protein kinase 70 (p-ZAP70)/ZAP70, inducible T cell costimulator, programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1), interleukin-17 levels in the TCR pathway, and reduced phosphorylated tyrosine-protein kinase Lyn (p-LYN)/LYN, phosphorylated Ras-related C3 botulinum toxin substrate (p-Rac)/Rac, and anti-type II collagen antibody levels in the BCR pathway. Additionally, FHLJT decreased synovial fibroblast marker CD90 and angiogenesis proteins, and inhibited osteoclast markers. In vitro, FHLJT inhibited M1 macrophage differentiation and MHC II expression while promoting M2 differentiation. FHLJT exerts its therapeutic effects by simultaneously targeting multiple key pathological mechanisms of RA through 74 compounds (e.g., sinomenine) which modulate processes such as citrullinated protein production, antigen presentation, TCR and BCR signaling pathways, synovial hyperplasia, angiogenesis, osteoclast differentiation, and the PI3K-Akt and AMPK signaling pathways."
"Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a systemic autoimmune disease that leads to inflammation of synovial joints and other organs. Many RA patients ""share"" a common peptide sequence within the HLA-DR (MHC II) molecule expressed on antigen-presenting cells (APC), suggesting that HLA-DR+ cells are important in RA inflammation. We use HLA-DR positivity to comprehensively immunophenotype APC by spectral cytometry. We measured mean fluorescence intensities (MFI) of HLA-DR and molecules associated with dendritic cells (CD141, CD1c, CD163, CD11c, CD123, and CD303), monocytes (CD14 and CD16), granulocytic markers (CD15 and CCR3), co-stimulatory molecules (CD86 and CD275), and chemokine receptors (CCR2, CCR3, and CCR7) from RA patients and healthy donors by spectral flow cytometry. DC2 (CD1c+) showed higher CD86, CD275 (ICOS-L), CD56, and CCR7 in RA (all <i>p</i> < 0.05). CD56 was also increased in (CD163+) DC3 (<i>p</i> = 0.0453). CD15 was increased throughout RA dendritic cell subsets and classical and intermediate monocytes (all <i>p</i> < 0.01). Except for B cells, HLA-DR was not different in RA. A distinct HLA-DR+CD15+CD16+ population appeared in RA (<i>p</i> = 0.0004), which contributed a mean of 1.3% (± SD 2.85%) to the overall HLA-DR+ APC compartment. This HLA-DR+CD15+CD16+ subset was positive for CD83, CD275, and, like plasmacytoid pDC, CD303+. However, in contrast to pDC, it formed distinct t-SNE clusters and differed from reference pDC (CD123+CD303+) by much less CD123 (<i>p</i> < 0.01). The HLA-DR+CD15+CD16+ phenotype correlated with clinical markers of systemic inflammation (<i>p</i> < 0.01). In conclusion, dendritic cell and monocyte alterations in RA include an increased co-stimulatory phenotype of CD1c+ DC2 and CD163+ DC3 with increased CD56 and CD15 in dendritic cells and monocytes. Moreover, the blood of RA patients contains HLA-DR+ cells with shared dendritic cell and granulocytic features. These phenotypic characterizations of RA patients implicate CD1c+ DC2 and CD163+ DC3 in the systemic autoimmune disease rheumatoid arthritis and suggest that increased HLA-DR+ phenotypes with shared granulocytic and dendritic cell features can contribute to RA, potentially by providing enhanced co-stimulatory presentation of self-antigen(s) to CD4+ T lymphocytes."
"Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is an autoimmune disease characterized by chronic synovitis and joint destruction. To systematically investigate the regulatory relationship between key ferroptosis genes and gut metabolites in RA, this study employed an integrative multi-omics approach combined with machine learning algorithms and single-cell transcriptomic data, identifying and validating GPX3 and MYC as potential critical ferroptosis regulators in RA. First, 16 candidate genes were obtained by intersecting WGCNA, differential expression analysis results, and targets related to ferroptosis and gut microbiota. Following cross-validation with machine learning approaches including LASSO, SVM, and RFE-RF, GPX3 and MYC were ultimately identified as crucial genes. GSVA and GSEA analyses revealed that high expression of GPX3 and MYC was enriched in interferon response and TNFA signaling pathways, while their low expression was associated with fatty acid metabolism and oxidative phosphorylation pathways. Further single-cell RNA sequencing analysis demonstrated that MYC was expressed in multiple immune cell types, particularly in CD4+ T cells and NK cells. Ferroptosis scoring for CD8+ T cells and subsequent cell communication analysis revealed stronger interactions between CD8+ T cells with higher ferroptosis scores and other immune cells through IFN-II and CCL signaling, further intensifying the activation of the inflammatory microenvironment. Additionally, molecular docking analysis of GPX3 and MYC with the gut metabolites Diosgenin and Differentiation-inducing factor 3 (DIF-3) respectively showed that the GPX3-Diosgenin complex had the lowest binding energy, and a 100 ns molecular dynamics simulation was performed on this complex. Results showed good stability of the complex across indicators such as RMSD, RMSF, SASA, and radius of gyration, suggesting that Diosgenin may intervene in ferroptosis and inflammatory injury in RA by binding to and modulating GPX3 function. This study elucidated the multifaceted mechanisms of GPX3 and MYC in RA pathogenesis and preliminarily validated the potential role of gut metabolites in mediating ferroptosis regulation, offering novel theoretical foundations and potential strategies for diagnostic biomarker screening and targeted therapy in RA."
"Polyamino acids synthesized via ring-opening polymerization (ROP) of N-carboxyanhydride (NCA) monomers offer a scalable route to functional polypeptides, but the lack of sequence specificity limits their ability to fold and function like natural enzymes. Here, a series of artificial enzymes is developed based on single-chain nanoparticles (SCNPs) formed through intramolecular folding of a triblock copolypeptide, polyethylene glycol-b-poly(L-glutamic acid)-b-poly(oligo(ethylene glycol)-L-glutamate) (PEG<sub>113</sub>-b-PGlu<sub>112</sub>-b-P(Glu-EG<sub>2</sub>)<sub>99</sub>). The central poly-Glu block is intramolecularly cross-linked via coordination with transition metal ions (Fe<sup>2+</sup>/Fe<sup>3+</sup>, Mn<sup>2+</sup>, Co<sup>2+</sup>, Cu<sup>2+</sup>/Zn<sup>2+</sup>), mimicking the natural folding of polypeptides into proteins. Co-precipitation with ammonia water generates metal/alloy oxide nanoclusters within the cross-linked polyGlu domain, providing a large surface-to-volume ratio. The metal oxide nanoclusters function as coenzymes. They not only facilitate a structural transition from α-helices to β-strands within the cross-linked polyGlu domain but also demonstrate specific peroxidase (POD) or superoxide dismutase (SOD) activities, which are tailored to the specific metal species involved. The FeOx-complexed artificial enzyme (Fe-enzyme) is selected to exemplify its therapeutic effects of mitigating oxidative stress and inflammation in a rheumatoid arthritis mouse model. These artificial enzymes feature a soft, degradable polypeptide skeleton, tunable side-chain functionalities, high enzyme-like activity with minimal metal content (< 5 wt.%), and secondary structures similar to natural proteins."
"Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is an autoimmune disorder characterized by inflammation, with current Western treatments focusing on symptom relief and disease progression control through antiinflammatory, analgesic, and immunosuppressive drugs. However, these therapies have significant side effects and limited long-term efficacy. Therefore, novel treatment options are urgently needed. Lonicerae japonicae Caulis (LJC), a traditional Chinese medicine, has alleviated RA symptoms such as joint pain and swelling. Despite its widespread use, the underlying mechanisms of its therapeutic effects remain poorly understood. This research aimed to uncover the mechanisms by which LJC intervenes in RA, using transcriptomics and energy metabolomics. RA was induced in rats via Type II collagen and incomplete adjuvant. LJC's effects were assessed through joint swelling, TNF-α levels, and histopathology. Mechanisms were analyzed using transcriptomics and metabolomics. The role of chlorogenic acid (CGA) was verified in LPS-induced RAW264.7 cells. LJC reduced joint swelling and TNF-α levels and inhibited synoviocyte proliferation and angiogenesis. Transcriptomics revealed LJC modulated RA pathways and inflammation. Metabolomics identified cis-aconitic acid as a key metabolite in energy metabolism. CGA was confirmed as the primary active component. LJC alleviates RA by inhibiting inflammation and modulating energy metabolism through multiple pathways."
"Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is an inflammatory and destructive autoimmune polyarthritis that causes pain, swelling and deformity in the joints. While clinical trials targeting GM-CSF in RA are showing promise, the potential side effects of anti-GM-CSF therapy highlight the need for identifying downstream mediators of GM-CSF action. CCL17, a downstream inflammatory mediator of GM-CSF in monocytes and macrophages, has been shown to mediate GM-CSF-driven inflammatory arthritis in animal models. CCL17 shares its receptor, CCR4, with CCL22; however, unlike CCL17, CCL22 has been implicated in resolving inflammation. Therefore, drugs that can suppress the formation of CCL17, but not CCL22, may be beneficial in the treatment of inflammatory arthritis. In this study, we screened a panel of 1508 FDA-approved drugs and identified five drugs, namely fluoxetine, ractopamine, ponesimod, terbutaline and etravirine, which potently inhibited CCL17 production without adverse effects on cell viability and CCL22 formation in human monocytes and mouse macrophages. Mechanistically, we demonstrated that these drugs inhibited STAT5 activity and IRF4 expression to suppress CCL17 formation. Significantly, therapeutic administration of these five drugs in an inflammatory arthritis model revealed that fluoxetine, ractopamine, ponesimod and terbutaline could inhibit arthritic pain, correlating with decreased CCL17 expression. Given the need for new and safe anti-inflammatory therapeutics to treat RA and the benefits of repurposing existing drugs for new indications, our findings reported here offer four new promising analgesics for treating inflammatory pain."
"Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic autoimmune disorder characterized by synovitis and presenting as symmetrical arthritis that primarily affects the small joints of the limbs. PIWI-interacting RNAs, a class of small noncoding RNAs, have garnered significant attention due to their critical involvement in various pathological conditions, including reproductive diseases, cancers and other disorders. Here we observe elevated levels of macrophage-derived piENOX2 in the synovial tissues of both patients with RA and mice with collagen-induced arthritis (CIA). It was found that transfection with a piENOX2 mimic promoted M1 macrophage polarization, while a piENOX2 inhibitor facilitated M2 polarization. In vivo, a piENOX2 inhibitor significantly alleviated disease progression, reduced systemic inflammation and preserved the integrity of articular cartilage in CIA mice. Mechanistic analyses indicated that the piENOX2 effects were due to its targeting Alkbh5 mRNA for degradation. In a Alkbh5 conditional-knockout mouse model of CIA, the therapeutic effects of a piENOX2 inhibitor, including inflammation suppression and cartilage protection, were reduced compared with control mice. A comprehensive analyses using methylated RNA immunoprecipitation sequencing and methylated RNA immunoprecipitation and quantitative PCR revealed that piENOX2 regulated ALKBH5-mediated m<sup>6</sup>A modification of Itga4 mRNA, thereby influencing macrophage polarization through the PI3K-AKT signaling pathway. These findings provide important insights into the complex roles of PIWI-interacting RNAs in RA progression and indicate potential avenues for therapeutic intervention."
"Fields that deal with systemic autoimmune diseases such as rheumatology, gastroenterology, and endocrinology have adopted the principles of immune modulation, including shifting immune activation sates, from advances originally developed in oncology. Most clinical trials to date have demonstrated efficacy of cell therapies primarily in in hematologic and solid tumors, largely driven by chimeric antigen receptor T (CAR-T) cells. In contrast, mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) have shown limited success in oncology applications. In this article we review the most recent clinical trials involving MSCs and their promising results for patients with systemic autoimmune rheumatic diseases that have failed to respond to standard of care (SOC) therapies."
"Connective tissue disease-associated interstitial lung disease is one of the most common subtypes of interstitial lung disease, which is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in patients with these systemic autoimmune rheumatic diseases. A spectrum of disease trajectories exists within individual and across different connective tissue diseases. In individuals with connective tissue diseases who are at risk or at the early asymptomatic stage with interstitial lung changes, we have potential windows of opportunity for interventions to prevent the development of or progression to interstitial lung disease. In this perspective, we use systemic sclerosis and rheumatoid arthritis as sample cases to discuss emerging knowledge on disease pathogenesis, as well as to apply the preventative medicine concept for pharmacotherapeutic approaches at different disease stages of connective tissue disease-associated interstitial lung disease."
"Chloroquine (CQ) has been used to treat rheumatoid arthritis and systemic lupus erythematosus, but its use in multiple sclerosis (MS) is limited by side effects and insufficient efficacy. To enhance treatment outcomes, understanding CQ's therapeutic mechanisms in MS is crucial. Thus, we administered CQ to mice with experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) and investigated its disease-ameliorating effects and underlying cellular mechanisms. CQ was applied intraperitoneally six days after EAE induction, immune responses, with a focus on inflammatory and regulatory T cells, as well as dendritic cells in blood, lymph nodes, spleen, and bone marrow were analyzed by flow cytometry. CQ treatment significantly reduced cumulative disease score and maximal disease score in CQ-treated group. Immunohistochemical analysis of the spinal cords confirmed the reduced demyelination after CQ treatment, which is accompanied by significantly decreased infiltration of T cells, B cells, and macrophages, and less activated microglia cells. Flow cytometry analysis of peripheral lymphoid organs revealed a significant decrease of inflammatory Th17 cells, which is associated with reduced pDC and their IFN-α expression, as well as Treg cells in CQ-treated mice. Indeed, depletion of pDC alone or simultaneously with CQ treatment significantly reduced EAE severity. Our results demonstrated that CQ treatment inhibits the development of EAE disease on one hand by enhancing the expansion of Treg in dLN and spleen, and on the other hand by inhibiting the accumulation of pDC and their IFN-α expression in the spleen and bone marrow. This joint effort restricts the level of inflammation in peripheral and later in CNS. Furthermore, developing a pDC-targeted CQ treatment will not only increase the treatment efficiency, but also largely decrease side effects."
"Chronomodulated diseases demonstrate circadian fluctuations. Conventional dosage forms are inadequate for mitigating these ailments; instead, time-scheduled drug release is necessary for pharmacological efficacy. The current investigation aims to develop natural, carbohydrate polymer-based novel plug-in capsule, pulsatile drug delivery system with engineered specificity of meloxicam with low aqueous solubility. β-CD is employed to boost solubility by forming solid ternary inclusion complexes where natural polymers, viz., pectin and agar, act as ternary agents. Plug-in capsule device is prepared using formaldehyde-treated capsule bodies and optimized by 3<sup>2</sup>full factorial design by considering concentrations of HPMC-E15 (X<sub>1</sub>) and psyllium husk (X<sub>2</sub>) as independent variables and lag time (Y<sub>1</sub>), time required to release 80 % drug (Y<sub>2</sub>), release of drug at 6 h, (Y<sub>3</sub>) as responses. Dissolution order was ternary complex (pectin 60.21 %) > ternary complex (agar 53.64 %) > binary complex (41.56 %) > pure drug (18.87 %). Batch F6, demonstrated a significant lag time of 6.15 ± 0.07 h followed by maximum drug release (85.21 % at 60 min) from its ternary complex containing β-CD and pectin. X<sub>1</sub> and X<sub>2</sub> demonstrates significant positive effects on Y<sub>1</sub> and Y<sub>2</sub> but decrease in Y<sub>3</sub>. Thus, developed formulation serves as remedy for early morning pain with stiffness that rheumatoid arthritis patients experience, as it follows circadian pattern. Simultaneously, it maximizes drug delivery and achieves desired therapeutic effect, thus eliminating risk of early morning pain."
"The present study aimed to evaluate the long-term survival of patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) receiving biologic or targeted synthetic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (b/tsDMARDs) in a real-world setting, and to identify key prognostic factors influencing mortality within this cohort. This retrospective, observational cohort study analyzed 165 patients with confirmed RA who were on b/tsDMARD treatment for at least six months as of June 2017. Patient data, including demographics, disease duration, prior therapeutic regimens, and global functional status were extracted from medical records to collect data covering a seven-year follow-up period, extending from June 2017 to December 2024. Corticosteroid use was defined as continuous systemic intake during the RA activity analysis period. Survival outcomes were analyzed using Kaplan-Meier methods and multivariate Cox proportional hazards models to identify independent predictors of mortality. Over a mean follow-up of 9.4 years, the mortality rate was 13.5 deaths per 1000 treatment-years, with an overall survival rate of 87.3%. Advanced functional disability and prolonged corticosteroid use were independently associated with higher mortality risk. In subgroup analyses, chronic kidney disease significantly increased mortality among patients on TNF inhibitors. In contrast, patients who remained on their initial anti-IL6 therapy had lower mortality, though this may reflect survivor bias. This study highlights the importance of long-term b/tsDMARD intervention in RA patients, with observed low mortality and high survival rates. Subgroup findings suggest the importance of comorbidity management in TNFi users and therapeutic stability in anti-IL6 users."
"<b>Background</b>: Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic autoimmune disorder that predominantly affects synovial joints, leading to inflammation, pain, and progressive joint damage. Despite therapeutic advancements, the molecular basis of established RA remains poorly defined. <b>Methods:</b> In this study, we conducted an untargeted plasma proteomic analysis using two-dimensional differential gel electrophoresis (2D-DIGE) and matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF-MS) in samples from RA patients and healthy controls in the discovery phase. <b>Results:</b> Significantly (ANOVA, <i>p</i> ≤ 0.05, fold change > 1.5) differentially abundant proteins (DAPs) were identified. Notably, upregulated proteins included mitochondrial dicarboxylate carrier, hemopexin, and 28S ribosomal protein S18c, while CCDC124, osteocalcin, apolipoproteins A-I and A-IV, and haptoglobin were downregulated. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis identified CCDC124, osteocalcin, and metallothionein-2 with high diagnostic potential (AUC = 0.98). Proteins with the highest selected frequency were quantitatively verified by multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) analysis in the validation cohort. Bioinformatic analysis using Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) revealed the underlying molecular pathways and key interaction networks involved STAT1, TNF, and CD40. These central nodes were associated with immune regulation, cell-to-cell signaling, and hematological system development. <b>Conclusions:</b> Our combined proteomic and bioinformatic approaches underscore the involvement of dysregulated immune pathways in RA pathogenesis and highlight potential diagnostic biomarkers. The utility of these markers needs to be evaluated in further studies and in a larger cohort of patients."
"Tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) plays important roles in inflammation and bone destruction in rheumatoid arthritis (RA), but the detailed mechanism is still not fully elucidated. Here, we found that the levels of microRNA (miR)-103a-3p were decreased markedly in the inflamed synovial tissues of patients with RA compared with osteoarthritis (OA) or healthy control subjects. Further studies uncovered that miR-103a-3p was significantly downregulated by TNF-α/IL-1β in RA fibroblast-like synoviocytes (FLSs) through an NF-κB-dependent manner via the de novo produced transcription factor Yin Yang 1 (YY1). In addition, downregulation of miR-103a-3p in FLSs promoted NF-κB signaling pathway activation, inflammatory cytokines secretion, and bone marrow-derived monocytes (BMMs) cells differentiation into osteoclasts, whereas ectopic expression of miR-103a-3p had the opposite effects. Notably, miR-103a-3p was downregulated thousands of times in the sera of RA patients and CIA mice, while the blockade of TNF-α with infliximab greatly recovered its levels in RA patients in sustained remission. Consistently, rescue of miR-103a-3p expression by an agomiR potently ameliorated inflammatory responses and bone erosion in CIA mice. Mechanistically, mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase 7 (MAP3K7) and Dickkopf-related protein 1 (DKK1) were identified as the direct targets of miR-103a-3p, by which it exerts the effects on synovial inflammation and cartilage bone destruction. Taken together, miR-103a-3p mediates TNF-triggered synovial inflammation and joint bone destruction via targeting MAP3K7 and DKK1; it thus serves as a candidate target for RA treatment."
"Autoimmune diseases are driven by chronic inflammation and oxidative stress, thus requiring innovative therapeutic approaches. Polymeric nanotherapeutics incorporating antioxidant bioactive compounds offer a promising strategy for immune modulation and enhanced drug delivery. This review explores the application of polymer-based nanocarriers for improving the solubility, bioavailability, and targeted delivery of antioxidant compounds in autoimmune disease treatment. A comprehensive analysis of recent advancements in polymeric nanoformulations, including poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA), polyethylene glycol (PEG), chitosan, and hyaluronic acid, was conducted. The therapeutic efficacy of various antioxidant-loaded nanoparticles has been assessed in both preclinical and clinical studies. Phenolic antioxidants, such as resveratrol, curcumin, quercetin, and epigallocatechin-3-gallate, exhibit potent anti-inflammatory effects; however, their poor solubility limits their clinical application. Nanocarriers such as dendrosomes, tannic acid-based reactive oxygen species (ROS)-scavenging nanoparticles, and folic acid-functionalized systems enhance drug stability, controlled drug release, and macrophage targeting. Carotenoid and bilirubin nanoparticles further demonstrate immunomodulatory effects in multiple sclerosis, psoriasis, rheumatoid arthritis, and inflammatory bowel disease. Polymeric antioxidant nanotherapeutics provide targeted and sustained drug delivery, offering improved efficacy and reduced toxicity. Future research should focus on optimizing these nanocarriers for clinical translation and patient-centered therapeutic strategies."
"Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic autoimmune disease characterized by systemic inflammation that primarily affects the joints but can also involve extra-articular organs. Its multifactorial etiology remains incompletely understood, necessitating further investigation into its underlying mechanisms. The primary therapeutic goal in RA management is to achieve disease remission or maintain low RA activity to prevent long-term morbidity. RA therapies aim to mitigate joint damage, reduce disability, and prevent systemic complications such as cardiovascular diseases. In addition to pharmacological treatments, non-pharmacological interventions-including physiotherapy, occupational therapy, and lifestyle modifications such as smoking cessation, regular exercise, and adherence to a balanced diet-play a crucial role in managing the disease. Beyond joint inflammation, RA has been strongly associated with an increased risk of thrombosis, contributing significantly to both morbidity and mortality. The link between RA and thrombotic events arises from a complex interplay of inflammatory pathways, endothelial dysfunction, and coagulation abnormalities. This review provides an in-depth analysis of the mechanisms driving the association between thrombo-inflammatory manifestations and the incidence of RA, the impact of RA treatment on thrombosis prevalence, and potential therapeutic strategies for managing both conditions concurrently. By integrating recent advancements in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) pathophysiology and thrombo-inflammatory research, this paper provides a comprehensive resource on the inflammatory link between RA and thrombosis while discussing and comparing current and emerging treatment approaches. Further investigation into these mechanisms could facilitate the development of targeted therapies that reduce the risk of thrombosis in patients with RA."
"Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic autoimmune disorder characterized by persistent synovial inflammation, joint destruction, and systemic complications. The nucleotide-binding domain, leucine-rich repeat family, pyrin domain-containing-3 (NLRP3) inflammasome plays a pivotal role in RA pathogenesis by driving the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines and exacerbating oxidative stress. Recent studies identified methyl canthin-6-one-2-carboxylate (Cant) as a potential therapeutic agent that modulates the NLRP3 inflammasome pathway. This review explores the mechanistic role of Cant in RA treatment, particularly its effect on oxidative stress, synovial macrophages, and inflammatory signaling pathways. Additionally, we discuss alternative and complementary approaches, such as gut microbiota modulation and mesenchymal stem cell-based therapies, in the management of RA. Although preliminary findings suggest that Cant exhibits promising anti-inflammatory effects, further preclinical and clinical studies are necessary to validate its therapeutic efficacy. Future research should focus on optimizing dosage, exploring combination therapies, and elucidating the broader implications of targeting the NLRP3 inflammasome for RA treatment."
"Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic systemic inflammatory disease associated with increased cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Myocardial fibrosis, a key pathological consequence of prolonged inflammation, contributes to diastolic dysfunction and the development of heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) in RA patients. Understanding its pathophysiology, early detection, and potential therapeutic strategies is crucial for improving patient outcomes. In this study we explore the underlying mechanisms of myocardial fibrosis in RA, focusing on immune-mediated pathways, oxidative stress, and extracellular matrix dysregulation, with concise look at the impact of immunosuppressive therapy on cardiac remodeling and role of speckle-tracking echocardiography (STE) in detecting subclinical myocardial fibrosis, emphasizing global longitudinal strain (GLS) as a promising surrogate marker. Key words Rheumatoid arthritis "" Myocardial fibrosis "" Diastolic dysfunction "" Cardiovascular disease surveillance "" Strain echocardiography."
"Neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (NMOSD) is an immune-mediated, typically relapsing central nervous system demyelinating disorder characterized by optic neuritis (ON) and transverse myelitis (TM). While systemic or organ-specific autoimmune comorbidities are well-documented in 20-30% of adult NMOSD cases, such associations remain rarely reported in pediatric populations. We present a 14-year-old girl with NMOSD coexisting with primary Sjögren's syndrome (pSS). At 11 years of age, she presented with acute right-sided headache, painful eye movements, and vision loss. Diagnostic workup confirmed AQP4-IgG seropositivity, ON, and corresponding T2-hyperintense lesions on optic nerve MRI, meeting 2023 Neuromyelitis Optica Study Group (NEMOS) revised recommendations. Acute-phase treatment included intravenous methylprednisolone and intravenous immunoglobulin, followed by maintenance therapy with oral prednisone and mycophenolate mofetil (MMF), with gradual prednisolone tapering. Right-eye vision normalized after intervention. Initial workup revealed positive antinuclear antibody (ANA), anti-Ro/SSA, anti-La/SSB, and elevated alanine aminotransferase (ALT)/aspartate aminotransferase (AST). Aged 12.5 years, labial salivary gland biopsy for persistent transaminitis showed focal lymphocytic sialadenitis (focus score ≥1 focus/4 mm²), satisfying the 2016 ACR/EULAR criteria for pSS. At 13.5 years, MMF was switched to tacrolimus due to persistent ALT/AST elevation, leading to biochemical normalization. No NMOSD relapses occurred post-initial episode. This case highlights the rare but clinically important co-occurrence of NMOSD and pSS in children. Routine screening for autoantibodies (e.g., ANA, organ-specific antibodies) in pediatric NMOSD is warranted to detect comorbid autoimmune disorders. Targeted therapy for concurrent connective tissue diseases can optimize clinical outcomes and quality of life."
"This study aimed to evaluate the utility of machine learning algorithms in differentiating rheumatoid arthritis-Sjögren's syndrome overlap (RA-SS) from Sjögren's syndrome with polyarthritis (SS-PA), and to identify key factors influencing diagnostic differentiation. This retrospective analysis included 106 RA-SS and 135 SS-PA patients randomized 7:3 into training and validation sets. Clinical, laboratory, and radiographic data were collected. Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) regression facilitated feature selection before constructing diagnostic models using four machine learning algorithms, with feature importance quantified through SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP). The random forest algorithm demonstrated superior performance (AUC=0.854, 95% CI: 0.747-0.944) compared to other machine learning algorithms. SHAP analysis identified anti-CCP level, rheumatoid factor (RF) level, erosive joint count, anti-SSA/Ro60 antibodies, and C-reactive protein (CRP) as critical discriminating factors between RA-SS and SS-PA. The random forest algorithm demonstrates promising clinical potential for RA-SS and SS-PA differential diagnosis, with diagnostic efficiency surpassing traditional logistic regression (LR), offering a new approach for clinical differentiation."
"To compare the risk of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) between patients newly diagnosed with RA and individuals without RA. This large-scale study aims to provide novel insights into the association between RA and COPD by evaluating the impact of clinical factors and medications on COPD risk, using robust propensity-score matching. This retrospective comparative cohort study utilized data from the TriNetX Research Network, collected on October 9, 2023. Patients newly diagnosed with RA from 2010 to 2021 were compared to non-RA individuals matched on demographics and medical history. Propensity-score matching balanced baseline covariates. The primary outcome was the 5-year risk of newly onset COPD (ICD-10: J41-J44), analyzed using Kaplan-Meier and Cox's proportional hazards models. The study included 136,820 pairs of RA and non-RA patients. The 5-year cumulative probability of COPD was 7.36% in the RA cohort versus 5.97% in the non-RA cohort, with a hazard ratio of 1.228 (95% CI = 1.186-1.272). Subgroup analyses showed higher COPD risk in RA patients across different demographics and clinical factors. Males, older patients, higher rheumatoid factor, and higher erythrocyte sedimentation rate increased COPD risk, while DMARDs and systemic NSAIDs reduced it. RA patients have a significantly higher risk of developing COPD compared to non-RA individuals. These findings underscore the importance of targeted COPD prevention and management in RA patients."
"In this study computational methods were used to explore the anti-inflammatory properties of <i>Capparis</i> (<i>C.</i>) <i>sepiaria</i> extracts; focusing on their activity against pro-inflammatory cytokine, interleukin-1 (IL-1). Molecular docking was performed on 18 <i>C. sepiaria</i> phytoconstituents using AutoDock VinaXB. The study identified five compounds (CIDs 8122, 33934, 605626, 638072, 5363269) with high affinity for IL-1. Notably, CID 638072 demonstrated superior binding affinity compared to standard controls such as thalidomide. Pharmacokinetic and toxicity profiles were assessed using SwissADME and pkCSM which showed that all these compounds met acceptable criteria as promising anti-inflammatory agents. Molecular dynamics simulations with GROMACS (version 2019) confirmed the stability and interaction dynamics of these compounds, which support the docking results. The findings validate the traditional medicinal use of <i>C. sepiaria</i> for the treatment of inflammation, suggesting that CID 638072 holds significant potential for further development into a natural anti-inflammatory therapeutic. This research provides clues for the therapeutic applications of <i>C. sepiaria</i>, advancing the search for effective natural remedies for the treatment of inflammation. Further experimental validation is necessary to transition this study from computational predictions to clinical applications."
"Peptidyl arginine deiminase 4 (PAD4) is a protein that catalyzes both normal and abnormal citrullination of interacting protein partners, affecting gene regulation and being associated with diseases such as Alzheimer's, cancer, and rheumatoid arthritis (RA). As a result, PAD4 has emerged as a potential therapeutic target; however, no inhibitors have been approved to date. In this study, the REFRAME and ZINC15 drug databases were virtually screened. The approach used molecular docking and dynamics simulation techniques to identify compounds with high-predicted binding affinity to PAD4 (PDB ID: 4DKT). Selected hits from this virtual screening underwent <i>in vitro</i> assays using fixed concentrations derived from the docking score to evaluate their ability to inhibit PAD4 activity, and their effect on neutrophil extracellular trap (NET) release was assessed using an <i>ex vivo</i> human neutrophil model. Computational analyses identified amodiaquine, folic acid, and pyroxamide as stable PAD4 binders. <i>In vitro</i> inhibition assays revealed that amodiaquine (5.0 μM to 1.0 nM) and pyroxamide (0.1 μM) were more potent inhibitors than the reference PAD4 inhibitor BBCla (8.8 μM), while folic acid showed a non-significant trend toward inhibition. Cytotoxicity assays confirmed that all compounds were non-toxic at the tested concentrations, except for amodiaquine at 50 μM. NETosis assays demonstrated that the three selected compounds altered chromatin decondensation and cellular morphology similarly to BBCla, although not uniformly across all cells. Overall, amodiaquine, folic acid, and pyroxamide were identified as PAD4 inhibitors through combined virtual and experimental approaches, supporting their potential as therapeutic candidates for PAD4-related diseases and warranting further investigation."
"Patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) are more likely to comorbid renal diseases, with membranous nephropathy (MN) being the most common. This study aimed to explore the common pathogenesis between RA and MN using integrated bioinformatics analysis. Bulk and single-cell RNA sequencing datasets were obtained from the Gene Expression Omnibus and ImmPort databases. Differential expressed genes (DEGs) were identified and enrichment analysis was performed. Topology analysis and the random forest algorithm were applied to identify hub genes. The single-sample Gene Set Enrichment Analysis method was used to assess immune infiltration. Single-cell RNA sequencing analysis was employed to compare the transcript levels of key gene across different cell types. Pseudotime analysis was conducted using Monocle3, and cellular communication was analyzed with CellChat. The L1000FWD database was used to identify potential drugs, and molecular docking was performed. 66 common upregulated DEGs were identified, primarily associated with leukocyte migration and the chemokine signaling pathway. ITGB2 was finally identified as the shared pathogenic gene of both RA and MN. ITGB2 was predominantly expressed in macrophages, and its expression increased as M0 macrophages differentiated into M1 macrophages. BAFF signaling between macrophages with high ITGB2 expression and B cells/plasma cells was enhanced. Small molecules targeting ITGB2, including LY-294002 and CP466722, may serve as potential drugs for both RA and MN. As the pathogenic gene shared by both RA and MN, ITGB2 may play a role in M1 macrophage polarization and contribute to the maturation and differentiation of B cells through BAFF signaling."
"The main objective of the study was to determine the association of genes AIRE (rs2075876), CD40 (rs4810485), HLA-DRB1 (rs6457617) and TRAF1/C5 (rs10818488) polymorphisms with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) from the population of Pakistan. Blood samples of 300 RA patients and 300 healthy controls were taken from different hospitals in Pakistan. Extraction of DNA was carried out; a specific region of DNA was amplified using PCR. Polymorphic analysis was performed for genes AIRE (rs2075876), CD40 (rs4810485), HLA-DRB1 (rs6457617) and TRAF1/C5 (rs10818488). The demographic parameters, like age, showed statistically significant association and increased the risk of the disease up to 2-fold (odds ratio [OR] = 2.57; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.60-4.12; p = 0.0001). Gender and family history did not show any significant association with arthritis (OR = 1.12; 95% CI = 0.69-1.81; p = 0.6260; OR = 0.70; 95% CI = 0.44-1.11; p = 0.1313, respectively). In the case of smoking status, the difference was statistically significant for both smokers and non-smokers. In smokers, there was a decreased risk of RA (OR = 0.45; 95% CI = 0.28-0.73; p = 0.0011), and in non-smokers, there was an increased risk of disease up to 2-fold (OR = 2.17; 95% CI = 1.36-3.47; p = 0.0011). In AIRE gene, heterozygous (AG) of rs2075876 showed a highly significant association with increased risk of RA up to 3-fold (OR = 3.39; 95% CI = 2.08-5.54; p = 0.0001), whereas homozygous mutant (GG) also showed significant association (OR = 0.43; 95% CI = 0.26-0.72; p = 0.0014) but with decreased risk. In CD40 gene, heterozygous (AG) of rs4810485 showed significant association with a decreased risk of RA (OR = 0.59; 95% CI = 0.377-0.945; p = 0.027), whereas the homozygous mutant (GG) of rs4810485 showed highly significant association by increasing risk of up to 4-fold (OR = 4.318; 95% CI = 2.553-7.303; p = 0.0001). In HLA-DRB1 gene, heterozygous (CT) of rs6457617 showed significant association with a decreased risk of disease (OR = 0.52; 95% CI = 0.35-0.85; p = 0.007), whereas the homozygous mutant (TT) of rs6457617 showed highly significant association by increasing the risk of RA up to 4-fold (OR = 4.37; 95% CI = 2.55-7.47; p = 0.0001). In the TRAF1/C5 gene, heterozygosity (AG) of rs10818488 showed a significant association with an increased risk of disease up to 4-fold (OR = 4.06; 95% CI = 2.38-6.98; p = 0.0001). Highly significant associations of genes AIRE (rs2075876), CD40 (rs4810485), HLA-DRB1 (rs6457617) and TRAF1/C5 (rs10818488) polymorphisms were observed with RA."
"Cell-free DNA (cfDNA), reactive oxygen species (ROS), and pro-inflammatory cytokines interplay to form a self-amplified inflammatory cascade in autoimmune diseases (AIDs), accounting for the limited efficacy of single-target therapeutic modalities. Herein, biomimetic nanoparticles (NPs), constructed from macrophage membrane (RM)-coated cerium oxide (CeO<sub>2</sub>), are developed to concurrently scavenge multiple inflammatory mediators for AID management. Upon systemic administration, the NPs feature long blood circulation and targeted accumulation at the inflamed site. In the inflammatory microenvironment, RM with abundant cytokine receptors neutralizes varieties of pro-inflammatory cytokines, and CeO<sub>2</sub> with nuclease- and antioxidase-like activities scavenges multiple types of ROS. In addition, O<sub>2</sub> bubbles generated from CeO<sub>2</sub>-catalyzed H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> decomposition foster membrane shedding and subsequent CeO<sub>2</sub> exposure for effective cfDNA cleavage. Thus, the NPs effectively interrupt the inflammatory cycle and promote tissue repair in mouse models of AIDs including rheumatoid arthritis and autoimmune hepatitis. This study provides an effective mechanism for the multi-target management of inflammation, which holds profound implications for the treatment of AIDs."
"To investigate the supplementary value of the neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) in diagnosing rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and assessing disease activity, particularly in seronegative RA. This retrospective single-center study included 304 patients from the Department of Rheumatology and Immunology at a tertiary hospital between February 2021 and February 2024. The RA group consisted of 201 patients, and the non-RA control group had 103 patients. Demographic characteristics, blood tests, inflammatory markers (C-reactive protein, erythrocyte sedimentation rate), autoantibodies (rheumatoid factor, anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide antibody), and clinical evaluation data (Disease Activity Score in 28 Joints score) were collected. Multivariate logistic and ordinal logistic regression analyses were performed to identify RA-related factors. The combined diagnostic benefit of NLR was assessed using area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), net reclassification improvement, and integrated discrimination improvement. Among the 304 subjects, 201 were RA patients (mean age 52.3 ± 11.8 yr, 78.6% female) and 103 were non-RA controls (mean age 50.6 ± 10.2 yr, 73.8% female). The NLR in the RA group was significantly higher than in the non-RA group (3.2 [2.1-4.8] vs 1.8 [1.2-2.3], P < .001). Multivariate regression analysis showed that NLR was an independent predictor for RA diagnosis (odds ratio = 2.15, 95% confidence interval: 1.62-2.85, P < .001), with better diagnostic performance than C-reactive protein and erythrocyte sedimentation rate. In seronegative RA patients, NLR remained significantly diagnostic (odds ratio = 2.01, 95% confidence interval: 1.20-3.37, P = .008). NLR positively correlated with disease activity and was higher in moderate-to-high activity patients (4.2 [3.2-5.5], P < .001). Incremental analysis showed that NLR improved model performance: in the RA population, AUC increased from 0.89 to 0.94 (ΔAUC = 0.05, P < .001), and in seronegative RA, AUC increased from 0.72 to 0.82 (P = .002). For disease activity prediction, AUC increased from 0.85 to 0.91 (ΔAUC = 0.06, P = .004), with significant improvements in net reclassification improvement and integrated discrimination improvement (0.18 and 0.07, respectively). NLR is an independent predictor for diagnosing RA and assessing disease activity, particularly in seronegative RA. It enhances diagnostic sensitivity and model discriminative ability and should be promoted as a key inflammatory biomarker for early RA diagnosis."
"Communication between the gut microbiota and host post-translational modifications (PTMs) has been extensively characterized, and recent evidence delineates a functionally integrated gut microbiota-host PTM axis. This axis is not only essential for maintaining metabolism homeostasis but also plays diverse roles in regulating disease pathogenesis. In this review we discuss the emerging effects of microbial modulation of host PTMs by regulating substrate provisioning and enzyme activity. We also highlight the latest understanding of diverse microbiota-regulated PTMs in immune cell fate decision. Finally, we summarize the current understanding of how dysbiosis-induced PTM dysregulation drives pathologies in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), obesity-related diseases, rheumatoid arthritis (RA), chronic kidney disease (CKD), and colorectal cancer (CRC). We also propose targeted strategies to restore homeostasis through the microbiota-PTM axis."
"Early studies on T helper (Th) 9 cells and their specific cytokine IL-9 mainly focused on the field of allergic diseases. In addition to pathological studies, IL-9 can also affect the normal development and various functions of T cells and B cells. In recent years, a series of studies have found that IL-9 may play a pathogenic role in a range of autoimmune diseases, including rheumatoid arthritis (RA), systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), and multiple sclerosis (MS). Specifically, Th9 cells and IL-9 show abnormally high expression in peripheral blood, synovial fluid, and synovial tissue of patients with RA. Based on this, therapeutic strategies targeting IL-9, such as monoclonal antibodies, have become potential treatments for RA. However, research on Th9 and IL-9 in RA has only been conducted for less than two decades, and many issues are worth further exploration. This article reviews the molecular mechanisms underlying the pathogenic effects of Th9 and IL-9 in RA, summarizes the potential reasons for inducing abnormally high expression of Th9 and IL-9 in RA, and discusses future research directions. The existing evidence shows that Th9-derived IL-9 is a potential biomarker or therapeutic target in RA. We hope that this current review can play a bridging role and provide new ideas for the study of Th9 and IL-9 in RA."
"Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a devastating autoimmune disorder that imposes health and economic burdens on communities worldwide. Although stem cell transplantation has emerged as a promising option for RA management, the osteoimmune microenvironment that characterizes elevated reactive oxygen/nitrogen species (ROS/RNS) and poor oxygen (O<sub>2</sub>) supply compromise therapeutic efficiency. To address this issue, we present a nanozyme-reinforced hydrogel designed to modulate the immune microenvironment using a 'turning foes into friends' strategy, thereby enhancing the outcomes of stem cell therapy in RA. This hydrogel scavenges excessive ROS/RNS while synergistically generating O<sub>2</sub>, making it an effective protective vehicle for bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs). Moreover, it successfully induces macrophage polarization from the M1 to the M2 phenotype and facilitates the osteogenic differentiation of BMSCs, even under hostile oxidative conditions. Furthermore, hydrogel-mediated stem cell therapy is demonstrated to attenuate the onset of exacerbated synovial inflammation and promote bone remodeling in a severe rabbit RA model. This study offers a promising avenue for augmented stem cell therapy efficiency in RA management and provides translational significance for stem cell-based therapy even beyond autoimmune disorders."
"Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic systemic autoimmune disorder characterized by persistent synovial inflammation, cartilage degradation, and joint destruction. Central to RA pathogenesis is the mammalian target of the rapamycin (mTOR) signaling pathway, which regulates immune responses, cell proliferation, metabolism, and inflammation. Dysregulation of mTOR contributes to synovial hyperplasia, immune cell infiltration, and cytokine release. Although conventional therapies, including disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs and biologics, have improved clinical outcomes, their use is limited by cost, toxicity, and drug resistance. Phytochemicals-bioactive compounds derived from plants-have emerged as promising alternatives due to their immunomodulatory and anti-inflammatory properties, and their ability to target key molecular pathways, including mTOR. This review explores the role of phytochemicals such as curcumin, resveratrol, quercetin, epigallocatechin-3-gallate, luteolin, celastrol, astragalus, and others in modulating the mTOR pathway and their therapeutic potential in RA. It provides mechanistic insights into how these compounds affect inflammatory signaling, immune cell activation, and the behavior of fibroblast-like synoviocytes. Challenges associated with poor solubility, low bioavailability, and rapid metabolism are discussed, alongside advances in nanoformulations that enhance targeted delivery and efficacy. Preclinical and emerging clinical evidence supports the role of phytochemicals, alone or in combination with conventional agents, in suppressing RA pathogenesis. Overall, phytochemicals targeting the mTOR pathway offer a safe, cost-effective, and multifunctional therapeutic strategy for RA management."
"Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is associated with systemic bone loss and thus an established risk factor for osteoporosis. Janus kinase inhibitors (JAKi) have shown osteo-protective effects. However, clinical data on the effects of baricitinib on bone mineral density (BMD) remain limited. Therefore, we investigated the effects of a 1-year treatment with baricitinib on BMD in RA patients. Patients with active RA beginning treatment with baricitinib were included. BMD was measured at the lumbar spine and femoral neck using Dual-Energy X-Ray Absorptiometry (DXA). Disease activity was assessed using DAS28-CRP and cDAI. The primary endpoint was the change in BMD after 12 months. Secondary endpoints evaluated changes in disease activity, prednisolone dose and alkaline phosphatase (AP) levels and its relation to BMD. A total of 46 RA patients were recruited, of whom 26 completed the study. Overall, BMD remained stable. Non-responders to baricitinib (based on DAS28-CRP) showed a significant decline in spine BMD (- 2.12%, p = 0.039), while responders showed stable BMD. The between-group difference in spine BMD (p = 0.008) and T-score (p = 0.012) was significant. Demographic and clinical characteristics did not differ significantly between groups. Disease activity (DAS28-CRP: p = 0.003; cDAI: p = 0.007), prednisolone dose (p = 0.006), and AP levels (p = 0.03) all improved significantly. Under baricitinib, BMD loss appeared stabilized in RA patients. Non-responders to baricitinib experienced a significant loss of BMD with a significant difference to responders raising the question if seen effects are achieved by controlling disease activity or if there is an additional explicit JAKi effect on bone metabolism. Trial registration number: DRKS00020780, date: 13.3.2020."
"To promote a treat-to-target goal of tofacitinib therapy, there are unmet needs to predict therapeutic response before treatment. Utilising whole-exome sequencing (WES) and real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis, we aim to identify predictors of achieving remission after tofacitinib therapy in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients. We enrolled 242 patients who had received 24-week tofacitinib therapy, including 94 patients (Cohort-1) underwent WES analysis in the discovery stage and 148 patients (Cohort-2) were validated with RT-PCR assays or Sanger sequencing in the replication stage. Disease activity was assessed using the 28-joint disease activity score-erythrocyte sedimentation rate (DAS28-ESR), and therapeutic response at week24 was considered remission if DAS28-ESR <2.6. The WES analysis identified ten variants of RIN3, NLRC3, and SLX4 genes that were predictive of achieving remission after tofacitinib therapy, and its results were completely consistent with those from TaqMan assay or Sanger sequencing. Combined variants of RIN3, NLRC3, and SLX4 genes could predict achieving remission with AUC 0.831, specificity 97.4%, and accuracy 91.5% (Cohort-1). With validation in Cohort-2, a panel incorporating genetic variants of RIN3, NLRC3, and SLX4 showed a high specificity 97.0% and accuracy 86.0%. Using multiplexed one-step RT-PCR assay, this genetic panel still predicts remission with a high specificity 97.0% and accuracy of 88.0%. The significant differences in plasma levels of NLRC3, caspase-1, and IL-6 between the mutant gene and naive gene support the results of the gene ontology analysis. Combined variants of RIN3, NLRC3, and SLX4 genes have great potential for predicting remission in tofacitinib-treated patients."
"The optimal treatment strategy for rheumatoid arthritis-associated interstitial lung disease (RA-ILD) remains uncertain, and direct comparative data between biologics is limited. This study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of abatacept compared with rituximab in patients with RA-ILD. An emulated target trial was designed using the TriNetX US Collaborative Network database, including patients with RA-ILD, diagnosed between 2007 and 2024. Propensity score matching (PSM) was used to balance baseline characteristics between the two treatment groups (abatacept and rituximab). The primary outcome was all-cause mortality, while secondary outcomes included respiratory events, medical utilization, and infection-related adverse events. Hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were estimated to use Cox proportional hazards models. 1,615 patients per group were identified after matching for analysis. Abatacept was associated with a significantly lower risk of all-cause mortality compared with rituximab (HR 0.689, 95% CI 0.581-0.818) and a reduced risk of mechanical ventilation (HR 0.698, 95% CI 0.521-0.934). The subgroup analyses yielded consistent findings. Sensitivity analyses excluding patients with concomitant connective tissue diseases also demonstrated consistent results (mortality, HR 0.679, 95% CI 0.570-0.810), reinforcing the robustness of the findings. Abatacept was associated with a lower risk of mortality compared with rituximab in patients with RA-ILD. Because clinicians may preferentially reserve abatacept for less aggressive RA-ILD, residual confounding by indication cannot be excluded; thus, the association should not be interpreted as proof of causality. Prospective randomized trials are needed to confirm whether abatacept confers a true survival advantage."
"A drug preferred for its antimalarial effect called hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) has long been used to manage and avoid malaria. Nevertheless, its exact mode of action is still unknown. HCQ works through a variety of strategies to influence distinct molecular and cellular pathways. Additionally, HCQ has been demonstrated to be an effective treatment for rheumatic conditions such as primary Sjögren's syndrome, rheumatoid arthritis, antiphospholipid syndrome and systemic lupus erythematosus. Despite being widely regarded as safe, HCQ has been known to cause adverse responses; thus, doctors should closely evaluate rheumatism patients before taking these medications. The current study aims to emphasize the potential side effects of treatment while supporting the clinical usage of HCQ for autoimmune disorders."
"Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is an autoimmune disease, in which the abnormal activation and proliferation of effector T cells play a pivotal role in its pathogenesis. Regulatory T cells (Tregs) are a unique subset of immune cells with immunosuppressive functions, which help to inhibit the differentiation and proliferation of effector T cells in RA and maintain immune tolerance. The interaction between gut microbiota and immune cells has long been a research hotspot in autoimmune diseases. Although gut microbiota metabolites are considered to regulate the host's immune system as a bridge of the gut-joint axis, how gut microbiota acts on immunosuppressive Tregs remains unclear. This review summarizes that how the gut microbiota directly or indirectly (via metabolites) enhances the immunosuppressive capacity of Tregs. This enhancement is primarily achieved through pathways such as promoting the induction of Tregs, upregulating the expression of characteristic transcription factors of Tregs, and facilitating their secretion of anti-inflammatory cytokines, thereby ameliorating the inflammatory microenvironment and subsequently improving autoimmune conditions in RA."
"Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is an autoimmune disorder characterized by chronic joint inflammation driven by a complex interplay of autoantibodies, cytokines, and chemokines. While the role of proinflammatory cytokines, such as interleukin-1(IL-1), interleukin-6(IL-6), and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), in the pathogenesis of RA has been well-established, the contribution of the immunoglobulin G subclass IgG4 remains a topic of ongoing investigation. This cross sectional study aim was to compare the levels of IgG4 and these key inflammatory cytokines in Malaysian patients with RA. The study enrolled a total of 194 RA patients. All subjects were tested for their serum IgG4, IL-1, IL-6 and TNF-α levels. Besides, subjects were assessed for their disease activity based on DAS28, functional disability based on HAQ-DI (Health Assessment Questionnaire-Disability Index) and the severity of the radiographic joint erosions by using the Modified Sharp Score (MSS). Correlation analysis revealed a moderate positive association between IgG4 and IL-6 levels (r=0.348, p=0.001), but there were no significant correlations with IL-1 and TNFα levels. IgG4 levels showed a significant positive correlation with DAS28, MSS, and HAQ-DI. All 3 cytokine levels had significant relationships with the DAS28 scores, but for the MSS, only TNF-α (p=0.024) and IL-6 (p=0.016) demonstrated significant associations. None of the cytokines correlated significantly with the HAQ-DI scores. The positive correlation between IgG4 and IL-6 levels underscores the possibility for IL-6-driven pathways to influence IgG4 production. Serum IgG4 was associated with more clinical aspects of RA compared to the classical inflammatory cytokines."
"Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a complex autoimmune disease characterized by chronic synovitis of the joints, accompanied by systemic involvement of multiple systems. Resveratrol (Res) is a natural polyphenolic compound found in various plants, particularly abundant in grape skins, red wine, and peanuts. This article summarizes the pharmacological effects of Res in RA. Res can alleviate RA symptoms through various mechanisms, including inhibiting the production of inflammatory cytokines, suppressing synovial cell proliferation and angiogenesis, and protecting joint cartilage. For extra articular manifestations, Res mainly exhibits the effects of reducing inflammation of RA pulmonary interstitial disease (RA-ILD), improving the degree of pulmonary fibrosis, and reducing periodontal damage. Animal model studies support the anti-arthritis effect of Res, while clinical trials provide preliminary evidence of its potential benefits in reducing pain and improving quality of life in RA patients. Although early studies have shown that Res has anti RA potential, more large-scale, multicenter clinical trials are still needed to validate its safety and efficacy."
"Si Miao San is effective in ameliorating rheumatoid arthritis (RA) both clinically and experimentally. NETs play a fundamental role in the onset and progression of RA. The goal of this study was to explore the therapeutic effects of Si Miao San (SMS) on adjuvant-induced arthritis in mice and the regulatory mechanisms of NETs both in vivo and in vitro. SMS decoctions were identified using LC-MS/MS analysis and TCMSP. In the adjuvant induced RA murine model, SMS decoction and methotrexate were administered orally. Disease progression was analysed by assessing arthritic scores and joint diameter, H&E staining, safranin O-fast green staining, toluidine blue staining and micro-CT analysis. The expression of NE, MPO, PAD4, LC3B, CitH3, p-AKT and p-PI3K and the production of ROS were detected using IHC, WB and IF analyses. Cytokines in the sera of the mice were detected using cytometric bead arrays. After the in vitro culture of neutrophils, NE, MPO, PAD4, LC3B, CitH3, ROS, p-PI3K and p-AKT were measured using IF and WB analyses. Autophagy was further observed with TEM. SMS decoction compounds were first identified. Compared with the model group, SMS significantly inhibited joint swelling, inflammation progression and bone destruction. The levels of NE, MPO, PAD4, CitH3, LC3B, ROS production and relative expression of p-AKT and p-PI3K in joint tissues were significantly reduced in the SMS group compared to the model group (<i>P</i> < 0.05). In vitro culture, SMS-containing serum significantly reduced the LC3B-II/LC3B-I ratio and the relative expression levels of p-AKT and p-PI3K, as well as the levels of ROS, NE, MPO, PAD4, and CitH3 compared with those in the PMA-treated group (<i>P</i> < 0.05), which was abolished by the treatment with the AKT activator SC79. The SMS-induced suppression of inflammation in experimental RA occurred through the modulation of the AKT/ROS/autophagy axis."
"Chronic inflammatory diseases are driven by immune cell dysregulation and overproduction of pro-inflammatory molecules, such as tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFα). Super-enhancers (SEs) and their enhancer RNAs (eRNAs) are critical gene expression regulators and offer therapeutic potential beyond protein-targeting approaches. This work hypothesizes that targeting eRNAs could reduce chronic inflammation by modulating TNFα expression. This work generates TNF-9 knockout (KO) mice by deleting a Tnfα-regulating enhancer region. These mice exhibit significantly reduced Tnfα levels, improved disease outcomes, and diminished immune cell activation in models of rheumatoid arthritis (RA), psoriasis, and lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced sepsis. Integrative epigenomic and transcriptomic analysis identify additional LPS-responsive, eRNA-producing enhancers as therapeutic targets. Antisense oligonucleotide (ASO)-mediated knockdown of TNF-9 eRNA in mouse macrophages demonstrate decreased Tnfα expression and alleviated RA symptoms. Furthermore, ASO-mediated inhibition of the eRNA of the human homolog of TNF-9 similarly reduce TNFα levels. These findings support eRNA-targeted interventions as potential treatment for chronic inflammatory diseases."
"Rituximab is known as an efficacious drug for the treatment of Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA). The original administration schedule consisted of two infusions of 1000 mg with a 2-week interval. We aimed to explore the long-term effectiveness of rituximab in daily clinical practice in patients with RA. Data of patients with RA treated with rituximab in a tertiary university hospital (2006-2019) were retrospectively collected from rituximab initiation until December 1st 2019 or rituximab discontinuation, whichever came first. Rituximab retreatment was based on a treat-to-target-approach guided by a 28-joint disease activity score (DAS28) ≥ 3.2, as dictated by national reimbursement criteria. Rituximab retention rate was investigated using a Kaplan-Meier survival curve. We collected data of 104 patients (59% female, 94% RF/ACPA-seropositive). At rituximab initiation, patients had a mean ± SD age of 58 ± 12 years and median disease duration of 12 (IQR 5-17) years. Patients were followed for a median of 40 (IQR 14-80) months and received a median of 3 (IQR 2-6) rituximab cycles. In total, 9% (9/104) patients discontinued rituximab and 14% (15/104) were treated with a reduced dose. Inherent to the retreatment strategy, disease activity fluctuated with a DAS28-increase before every new rituximab administration. Similar fluctuations were noticed for patient and physician reported outcomes. Proportion of patients continuing rituximab after three years was 94% (95% CI 89% - 99%). Although rituximab can be considered as an efficacious drug for RA treatment in daily practice, fluctuations in disease activity were noticed related to the retreatment approach, accompanied by impaired patient's wellbeing. Not applicable."
"Rheumatoid factor (RF) binds to the immunoglobulin Fc portion, which might influence the efficacy of Fc-carrying TNF inhibitors (TNFi). This has been shown in studies in adults with RF-positive RA, but not yet in children. The aim of this study was to determine efficacy of TNFi in children with seropositive polyarthritis according to rheumatoid factor levels. Two databases were searched for patients with JIA/seropositive polyarthritis, admitted between November 2009 and March 2023. Data collected were demographic data, treatment with antirheumatic medications and JADAS27 and cJADAS27 prior to and after start of TNFi treatment. Changes in JADAS27 and cJADAS27 on TNFi were compared between patients with highly elevated RF (> 160 U/ml) and low titre RF (< 160 U/ml) using repeated measures ANOVA. 28 patients were included, 16 with RF < 160 U/ml at diagnosis, and 12 with RF ≥ 160 U/ml. 21 patients (75%) were treated with etanercept, three (11%) with adalimumab and four (14%) with golimumab, 23 patients additionally received methotrexate. Mean JADAS27 (cJADAS27) at treatment start was 23.0 ± 14.7 (21.0 ± 12.1), and 4.8 ± 5.0 (4.8 ± 4.7) at assessment after starting TNFi. Independent-samples t-test comparing percentage improvement as well as an ANCOVA determined that mean JADAS27 and cJADAS27 scores did not differ significantly across the two time points. Unlike in adults, efficacy of TNFi was not diminished by elevated levels of RF in this cohort of pediatric patients with seropositive polyarthritis. Further studies are necessary to confirm these findings."
"Strongyloides stercoralis (S. stercoralis) is a soil-transmitted nematode endemic to tropical and subtropical regions. While infections often remain asymptomatic in immunocompetent individuals, they can progress to hyperinfection or disseminated disease in immunocompromised hosts, particularly those receiving corticosteroid therapy. Disseminated strongyloidiasis is associated with a high mortality rate if not promptly diagnosed and treated. We present the case of a 45-year-old woman from northern Iran with a long-standing history of corticosteroid use for rheumatoid arthritis, who developed a non-healing ulcer on her back accompanied by gastrointestinal symptoms including vomiting, nausea, loss of appetite and diarrhea. Laboratory investigations confirmed the presence of S. stercoralis larvae in both stool specimens and a skin biopsy. Stool examination was performed using the stool culture method, and the biopsy was obtained from the lesion site. The patient was treated successfully with a combination of thiabendazole and ivermectin, leading to complete resolution of both cutaneous and gastrointestinal manifestations. This case underscores the importance of considering cutaneous strongyloidiasis in immunosuppressed patients, especially in endemic regions. Early recognition and prompt anti-parasitic therapy are critical for preventing severe complications and improving clinical outcomes."
"Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a systemic inflammatory condition posing challenges in identifying biomarkers for onset, severity and treatment responses. Here we investigate the plasma proteome in a longitudinal cohort of 278 RA patients, alongside 60 at-risk individuals and 99 healthy controls. We observe distinct proteome signatures in at-risk individuals and RA patients, with protein levels alterations correlating with disease activity, notably at DAS28-CRP thresholds of 3.1, 3.8 and 5.0. The combination of methotrexate (MTX) and leflunomide (LEF) modulates proinflammatory pathways, whereas MTX plus hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) impact energy metabolism. A machine-learning model is trained for predicting responses, and achieves average receiver operating characteristic (ROC) scores of 0.88 (MTX + LEF) and 0.82 (MTX + HCQ) in the testing sets. The efficiency of these models is further validated in independent cohorts using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay data. Overall, our study unveils distinct plasma proteome signatures across various stages and subtypes of RA, providing valuable biomarkers for predicting disease onset and treatment responses."
"Rheumatoid arthritis with depressive symptoms is frequently encountered in clinic. In this study, we investigated the molecular mechanisms responsible for comorbid depression with rheumatoid arthritis in collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) model mice. We showed that depression-like behaviors were developed at 5 weeks after establishing CIA model. Furthermore, we found that in the hippocampus of CIA mice, G-protein coupled receptor kinase 2 (GRK2) was significantly upregulated, while the expression of its target, corticotropin releasing hormone receptor 1 (CRHR1) was notably decreased, as was the downstream cAMP/PKA/CREB/BDNF signaling. We demonstrated that GRK2 could directly interact with CRHR1, suppressing CRHR1-dependent signaling. Knockdown of hippocampal GRK2 or pharmacological inhibition with CP-25 (35 mg·kg<sup>-1</sup>·d<sup>-1</sup>, i.g. for 21 days) could alleviate the depression-like behaviors in CIA mice, whereas GRK2 overexpression induced depression-like behaviors in naive mice. Our study identifies hippocampal GRK2 as a regulator of depression-like behaviors associated with rheumatoid arthritis in CIA model mice, suggesting both a therapeutic target and potential treatment strategy."
"To observe the effects of heat-reinforcing needling on inflammation and oxidative stress in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) model rats with cold syndrome, so as to analyze the mechanism of heat-reinforcing needling in improving RA. Male SD rats were randomly divided into blank group, model group, heat-reinforcing needling group and resveratrol group according to random number table method, with 12 rats in each group. The rat model of RA with cold syndrome was established by subcutaneous injection of bovine type II collagen and complete Freund adjuvant combined with the stimulation of cold and wet environment. After successful modeling, rats of the resveratrol group was intraperitoneally injected with resveratrol (the agonist of Sirt1, 10 mg/kg), and rats of the heat-reinforcing needling group received heat-reinforcing needling at ""Zusanli""(ST36)for 30 min every day. After 14 d of continuous intervention, the synovial morphology of knee joint was observed by HE staining. The activity of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px), contents of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and malondialdehyde (MDA) in serum were detected by WST-1 method, colorimetric method probe method, and TBA method, respectively. The mRNA and protein expression levels of silencing information regulatory factor 1 (Sirt1) and (FoxO1) in the synovial tissue of knee joint were detected by Western blot and qPCR, respectively. Compared with blank group, the fibroplasia, inflammatory cell infiltration, the relative expressions of Sirt1 mRNA and protein in synovial of knee joint, serum SOD and GSH-Px activity in model group were significantly decreased(<i>P</i><0.01), while the relative expressions of FoxO1 mRNA and protein, the contents of ROS and MDA were significantly increased(<i>P</i><0.01). After interventions, the decreased Sirt1 mRNA and protein, decreased SOD and GSH-Px activities, and the increased FoxO1 mRNA and protein, increased contents of ROS and MDA were reversed (<i>P</i><0.01, <i>P</i><0.05)in both of the heat-reinforcing needling and resveratrol groups. At the same time, the fibrous tissue proliferation and inflammatory cell infiltration around the synovial tissue of knee joint induced by RA were significantly reduced in both of the intervention groups. Heat-reinforcing needling can inhibit oxidative stress injury and inflammation response in RA rats with cold syndrome, which may be related to the regulation of Sirt1/FoxO1 pathway."
"Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic autoimmune inflammatory disease that affects approximately 0.5% to 1% of the population in the United States and Northern Europe. Interstitial lung disease (ILD) is the most common and severe pulmonary manifestation of RA, collectively referred to as RA-associated ILD (RA-ILD). RA-ILD contributes significantly to morbidity and mortality and often presents with a variable clinical course. Although corticosteroids and disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) remain the cornerstone of RA management, their role in RA-ILD is less clearly defined. In contrast, antifibrotic therapies such as pirfenidone and nintedanib, initially developed for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, are now being explored for their potential in treating fibrosing variants of RA-ILD. Despite increasing clinical use, no systematic review has comprehensively compared the safety and efficacy of antifibrotic versus anti-inflammatory therapies in chronic RA-ILD. This study aims to compare the impact of antifibrotic and anti-inflammatory therapies on lung function, radiologic progression, clinical outcomes, and safety in patients with chronic RA-ILD. This study will follow PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines and is registered with PROSPERO (CRD42024583847). A comprehensive search of PubMed, Embase, and the Cochrane Library will be conducted for studies published between January 1991 and August 2024. Eligible studies will include adult patients (aged ≥18 years) with a diagnosis of RA and confirmed ILD based on radiological or histopathological findings who have been treated with either antifibrotic or anti-inflammatory therapies. The PECOS (Population, Exposure, Comparator, Outcome, Study Design) framework will be used to define inclusion criteria. The primary outcomes assessed in this review will include the following pulmonary function parameters: forced vital capacity, forced expiratory volume in 1 second, and diffusing capacity of the lungs for carbon monoxide. Anti-inflammatory therapies will be stratified into corticosteroids, conventional synthetic DMARDs, and biologic DMARDs to account for heterogeneity. The Cochrane Risk of Bias 2 (RoB 2) and Risk of Bias in Non-randomized Studies - of Interventions (ROBINS-I) tools will be used for quality assessment, and GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation) methodology will be used to evaluate the certainty of evidence. The literature search and screening commenced in August 2024, and data extraction is underway. The final results are expected by December 2025. This systematic review and meta-analysis will provide a comprehensive comparison of antifibrotic and anti-inflammatory therapies in the treatment of chronic RA-ILD. The findings will help inform clinical decision-making, support evidence-based treatment selection, and identify gaps in current research. By addressing both efficacy and safety, this review aims to guide future studies and improve patient outcomes for this complex and debilitating condition.

"Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) and atrial fibrillation (AF), yet data on the clinical outcomes and management of AF in RA patients remain limited. This study aimed to evaluate the impact of RA on AF-related outcomes and treatment strategies. We conducted a retrospective cohort study using the TriNetX US collaborative network database, including adult patients diagnosed with AF between 2015 and 2025. Patients were divided into two cohorts based on the presence or absence of RA. Propensity score matching was performed to balance baseline characteristics. A total of 33,922 RA-AF patients and 33,922 non-RA AF patients were analyzed after matching. RA-AF patients exhibited a significantly higher risk of all-cause mortality (24.5% vs. 21.0%, OR: 1.216, p<0.001) and hospitalization or emergency department visits (72.2% vs. 69.2%, OR: 1.153, p<0.001). Additionally, RA-AF patients had a higher incidence of ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack (13.2% vs. 11.4%, OR: 1.180, p<0.001) and composite hemorrhagic events (14.4% vs. 10.6%, OR: 1.411, p<0.001). Notably, AF with rapid ventricular response (RVR) was more common in RA-AF patients (36.1% vs. 33.5%, OR: 1.122, p<0.001). Despite the elevated thromboembolic risk, RA-AF patients demonstrated lower utilization of anticoagulation (46.9% vs. 49.4%, OR: 0.905, p<0.001) and a preference for rate control over rhythm control strategies. RA-AF patients experience higher mortality, increased stroke and hemorrhagic risk, and more frequent hospitalizations compared to non-RA AF patients. Despite these risks, anticoagulation underutilization remains a concern."
"Relieving pain while treating rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a pressing clinical need to improve satisfaction of patients, which has not received the due attention and solution. Herein, we propose a strategy to kill two birds with one stone, for which we emphasize synergetic therapeutic outcome of analgesia and inhibiting RA progression through introducing hydrogen nanogenerator to scavenge reactive oxygen species (ROS) at lesion locations. This system exhibited efficient ROS scavenging and reducing apoptosis of C17.2 cells. In a complete Freund's Adjuvant-induced RA mouse model, this controlled hydrogen release behavior significantly downregulated pro-inflammatory mediators, protecting chondrocytes from apoptosis and preventing cartilage degradation. Furthermore, hydrogen therapy could effectively restrain the release of inflammatory factors and central sensitization by alleviating mitochondrial dysfunction in peripheral neurons and inhibit NF-κB pathway. Targeting ROS, this approach represents a significant advancement in RA management, offering superior efficacy against nociplastic pain compared to conventional analgesic therapies, providing a novel treatment mode of synergistic anti-inflammatory therapy and pain management."
"Macrophages are key effector cells in the pathogenesis of rheumatoid arthritis (RA), and the pro-inflammatory M1 phenotype accelerates the release of cytokines and exacerbates joint inflammation. In this study, a modified Fe-based metal-organic framework (Fe-MOF) was designed for RA treatment by co-delivering emodin (EM) and small interfering RNA of Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1 (siKEAP1). To target inflammatory lesions, hyaluronic acid (HA) was encapsulated on the surface of nanoparticles, thereby specifically binding to CD44 receptor overexpressed on M1 macrophage membranes. From the characterization, the synthesized EM/siKEAP1@Fe-MOF@HA exhibited a stable physicochemical profile and pH-responsive property. As expected, EM/siKEAP1@Fe-MOF@HA could effectively target macrophages and promote internalization through clathrin-mediated endocytosis. Both <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i> experiments confirmed that the internalized nanoparticles reduced the levels of inflammatory factors and reactive oxygen species and promoted M2 macrophage polarization by releasing EM and downregulating KEAP1. EM/siKEAP1@Fe-MOF@HA can also alleviate the pathological features of RA mice. More importantly, EM/siKEAP1@Fe-MOF@HA maintained an optimistic biosafety profile, avoiding liver and kidney toxicity and damage to major organs. Overall, this nano-delivery system reduced the pathological and inflammatory responses of RA by targeting macrophages and mediating their polarization, and thus could serve as a safe and effective strategy in the treatment of RA."
"Saposhnikovia divaricata (Turcz.) Schisch (SADS) is classified as a special-grade traditional Chinese medicine in Shennong's Materia Medical due to its immune-protective effects, including dispelling cold, relieving edema and pain, and its potential in treating rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Over 130 traditional Chinese medicine formulations containing SADS are used for RA treatment. However, the active ingredients and serum metabolites of SADS remain underexplored, and its precise mechanism of action in RA is not fully understood. Therefore, the study aims to explore the active ingredients and serum metabolites of SADS by UPLC-Q-TOF-MS and investigate its therapeutic mechanisms in the context of RA. A total of 5536 compounds were identified in SADS, and 19 active components were finally selected. In serum metabolites following SADS administration, 4945 compounds were identified, of which 17 showed anti-inflammatory activity. Network pharmacology analysis showed that SADS may play a role in the treatment of RA through the TNF and Receptor for Advanced Glycation End-products (RAGE) signaling pathway. SADS alleviated RA symptoms in IL-1RA deficient RA mice. In cellular models, SADS inhibited the abnormal proliferation of fibroblast-like synoviocytes through regulating the TNF-α and RAGE pathways. In addition, SADS promoted the polarization of M2 macrophages but inhibited the polarization of M1 macrophages. SADS alleviated the progression of experimental arthritis in a RA mouse model by modulating the TNF-α and RAGE signaling pathways, supporting its potential as a therapeutic agent for RA."
"The balance between bone formation by osteoblasts and bone resorption by osteoclasts is a critical step in maintaining bone homeostasis. Excessive activation of osteoclasts is important in the bone destruction seen in diseases such as osteoporosis and rheumatoid arthritis. The microenvironment around bone marrow cells regulates osteoclastogenesis through cytokine expression. Tumor necrosis factor-α (TNFα) is a proinflammatory cytokine that plays an important role in bone loss in rheumatoid arthritis. Therefore, this study investigated the effect of TNFα on osteoclastogenesis via chemokines produced by microenvironmental cells. In <i>in vitro</i> culture of mouse bone marrow cells, TNFα added simultaneously with receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa-B ligand (RANKL) and macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF) from the initiation of culture significantly inhibited osteoclast formation. By contrast, TNFα stimulation from 7 days after prior stimulation with RANKL and M-CSF significantly promoted osteoclastogenesis. This late-stage promotional effect was associated with the upregulation in non-adherent bone marrow cells of C-X3-C motif chemokine ligand 1 (CX3CL1) and C-X-C motif ligand 7 (CXCL7), which are potent chemoattractant and adhesion molecules. Neutralizing antibodies against TNF receptor 1 (TNFR1) and TNFR2 markedly suppressed osteoclastogenesis in the presence of TNFα. Additionally, these antibodies significantly reduced CX3CL1-but not CXCL7-mRNA expression levels in non-adherent bone marrow cells. In conclusion, our results suggest that TNFα treatment in the late stage promotes osteoclast formation and increases the expression of CX3CL1 in non-adherent bone marrow cells. These findings highlight the time-dependent role of TNFα in osteoclastogenesis relative to non-adherent bone marrow cells."
"Treatment efficacy of patients receiving anti-TNF antibodies is limited by the formation of anti-drug antibodies. These are observed in most adalimumab-treated rheumatoid arthritis patients, despite the adjuvant-free and human sequence-derived nature of the antibody. The class switched phenotype and high affinity of these antibodies suggest CD4 T-cell involvement in their formation. In this study, we investigated the potential epitopes in the functional domain of adalimumab and assessed their actual HLA II presentation and induction of CD4 T-cell responses in exposed patients. The binding strength of overlapping adalimumab-derived peptides to 27 DR and 14 DQ HLA alleles was predicted <i>in silico</i>. 10 strong and 44 medium-binding 10-mer peptides were identified within the variable regions of the heavy and light chain of adalimumab. HLA-DR-mediated antigen presentation of selected peptides by monocyte-derived dendritic cells was determined by mass spectrometry of the peptide pool eluted from isolated HLA-DR complexes. Binding of the variable region peptides of heavy (H41-62) and light chains (L18-39) was demonstrated. The presence of adalimumab-specific CD4 T-cells in adalimumab-experienced patients was investigated via peptide stimulation of peripheral blood mononuclear cells and assessment of T-cell proliferation. Anti-adalimumab CD4 T-cell responses were observed against four variable region peptides in a group of adalimumab-experienced RA patients. Some of these responses were also present in healthy control donors. This study identifies immunologically relevant CD4 T-cell epitopes in the variable region of the human therapeutic antibody adalimumab based on RA patients' reactivity. Modification of these epitopes or concomitant therapy that targets or prevents adalimumab-specific T cell responses could be beneficial for patients with significant anti-drug responses."
"Dendritic cells (DCs) play a central role in inducing both immunity and tolerance as specialized antigen-presenting cells (APCs). The immunometabolic firestorm in recent years has focused our attention on how DCs use energy and respond to nutritional changes that affect immune functions. Like in every other cell, such metabolic events as the concentration of free amino acids, membrane-bound transporter proteins, key metabolic enzymes, and sensors (e.g., mTOR and GCN2), also profoundly affect the function and fate of DCs. Therefore, dysregulation of amino acid metabolism can cause metabolic reprogramming of DCs, leading to or accelerating the occurrence of various immunological disorders, like type 1 diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis, and cancer. Since amino acids cannot directly enter the cell to participate in metabolic activities, their transporters act as critical metabolic gatekeepers. To catch up with the rapid development in the immune metabolism field, this review summarized recent studies on the potential roles of different amino acids and their transporters in the regulation of DCs biology to offer new insights for immune-dysregulated diseases and explore new therapeutic targets."
"Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic autoimmune inflammatory ailment which preferentially impacts the synovial membranes of joints and ultimately triggers cartilage and bone erosion. Angiotensin II (Ang II) participates in the pathogenesis of RA; hence, Ang II receptor blockade, accomplished through a specific inhibitor such as losartan potassium (LST), may confer an effective therapeutic avenue for RA. This study aimed to develop, optimize, and characterize LST-loaded leciplexes (LST-LPXs) to ameliorate its bioavailability and prolong its therapeutic efficacy for combating RA. To accomplish this objective, LST-LPX dispersions were assembled through a single-step process and optimized via D-optimal design for various physicochemical traits employing Design-Expert® software. Also, pharmacokinetic studies were explored in rats. Additionally, in complete Freund's adjuvant-induced RA in Wistar rats, RF, COMP, NADPH oxidase, NO, IL-6, TNF-α, besides Ang II and its receptors (AT1R & AT2R) were measured. The optimum LST-LPXs formulation elicited acceptable entrapment efficiency (88.05%), nano-scaled spherical morphology (246.71 nm), controlled release over 24 h (86.33%), and adequate permeation properties through the skin (417.83 μg/cm<sup>2</sup>). The pharmacokinetic analysis disclosed a snowballed bioavailability of the optimized LST-LPXs gel by 3.08- and 1.2-fold versus the oral solution and crude gel, respectively. The optimum LST-LPXs gel divulged accentuated anti-arthritic effects, evidenced by significant suppression of rheumatoid, oxidative stress, and inflammatory biomarkers coupled with corrections of AT1R and AT2R protein expression. Practically, the current findings proposed a compelling proof-of-principle that the transdermal LST-LPXs could serve as a non-invasive promising nanoparadigm for RA tackling."
"Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic inflammatory disease associated with systemic complications and progressive disability. Systemic side effects and poor drug delivery to joints limit current treatments. This study aimed to enhance the efficacy of tofacitinib (Tofa) by synthesizing novel pH-triggered biocompatible polymers, both folate-targeted and non-folate-targeted. First-generation polymers were synthesized and characterized using FT-IR and <sup>1</sup>HNMR spectroscopy. The critical micelle concentration of the copolymers was evaluated, and Tofa-loaded micelles were prepared using the dialysis method. The physical properties of the micelles were assessed using FE-SEM and dynamic light scattering. Cytotoxicity of Tofa/chondroitin sulfate-maleic-dexamethasone (Tofa/CHS-Mal-DEX) and Tofa/folic acid-polyethylene glycol-chondroitin sulfate-maleic-dexamethasone (Tofa/FA-PEG-CHS-Mal-DEX) micelles was evaluated on the fibroblastic L929 and RAW264.7. The cellular uptake and anti-inflammatory effects were investigated in the activated Raw 264.7 cell line. Tofa/CHS-Mal-DEX and Tofa/FA-PEG-CHS-Mal-DEX micelles exhibited particle sizes of 188 nm and 173.06 nm, respectively, with entrapment efficiencies of 51% and 72.76%. The release profiles exhibited that about 40% of Tofa was released from micelles over 62 h in physiological pH, whereas in acidic conditions, this significantly decreased to 2 h. Micelles demonstrated improved uptake efficiency, resulting in a significant reduction in IL-6 levels compared to free Tofa. None of the micelle formulations indicated cytotoxic effects on fibroblastic L929 and Raw 264.7 macrophage cell lines. The developed folate and non-folate-targeted micelles were not toxic and biocompatible for enhancing the therapeutic potential of Tofa in RA and improving drug delivery."
"This cross-sectional study aimed to investigate the association between the hemoglobin-to-red blood cell distribution width ratio (HRR) and rheumatoid arthritis in adults. Cross-sectional data from 22,352 participants in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 2009-2018 were analyzed. HRR was defined as hemoglobin concentration (g/dL) divided by red blood cell distribution width (%) and grouped into quartiles. The multivariable logistic regression model and restricted cubic spline (RCS) models assessed the connection between HRR and rheumatoid arthritis, adjusted for demographics, socioeconomic factors, and comorbidities. Our findings reveal a significant negative correlation between HRR measurements and rheumatoid arthritis susceptibility. Higher HRR quartiles showed progressively lower rheumatoid arthritis risk (quartile 4 vs. quartile 1: OR = 0.68, 95 % CI: 0.56,0.83). RCS revealed an inverse linear association after adjustment (P for overall <0.001; P for nonlinear = 0.174). HRR is inversely associated with rheumatoid arthritis risk, suggesting its potential as a biomarker for rheumatoid arthritis risk stratification. Nevertheless, additional investigations are required to corroborate these observations."
"Methotrexate (MTX) and leflunomide (LEF) are conventional synthetic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) commonly used for treating rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and psoriatic arthritis (PsA), either as monotherapies or in combination. This study aimed to compare the adverse effects (AEs) and efficacy of combined use of MTX plus LEF with monotherapy in RA and PsA patients. This study included 528 patients (385 RA and 143 PsA) with at least 6 months of follow-up. Disease activity was assessed using DAS-28 CRP and DAPSA, and treatment-related AEs were classified based on specific MedDRA categories. The cumulative incidence of AEs in patients with RA treated with MTX, LEF, and MTX plus LEF was 23.8%, 28.2%, and 19.2%, respectively; in PsA patients, 18.1%, 30%, and 23.3%, respectively. None of the groups were superior to each other in terms of general AEs between monotherapy and in combination. LEF monotherapy in RA was associated with more neurological AEs and hypertension. Compared to monotherapy, MTX plus LEF demonstrated greater reductions in disease activity, a more substantial decrease in glucocorticoid doses, and lower utilization of biological/targeted DMARDs (b/tsDMARDs) in both RA and PsA. In univariate analysis, MTX dosage, initial DAS28 CRP, and b/tsDMARD initiation were predictors of low disease activity (LDA) in RA. In multivariate analysis, MTX dosage (95% CI 1.02-1.59, OR = 1.27, p = 0.031) and initial DAS28-CRP (95% CI 2.14-10.90, OR = 4.38, p < 0.001) were found to be independently associated with LDA in RA. In PsA, the factors associated with LDA were initial DAPSA and disease duration in univariate analysis. Only disease duration was found to be an independent predictor in multivariate analysis (95% CI, 1.02-1.38, OR = 1.17 p = 0.039). Adding LEF to MTX or vice versa may serve as a valuable, safe, and effective alternative in situations where b/tsDMARD therapy is challenging."
"Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is an autoimmune disease that is characterized by persistent inflammation and progressive damage to the joints. In this study, it was aimed to explore the role of interleukin (IL)-40, a newly discovered cytokine, in the pathogenesis of RA. We also aimed to investigate the relationship between IL-40 and other cytokines such as IL-4, transforming growth factor (TGF)-β1 and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α. This single-center, cross-sectional study included 87 participants divided into three groups: healthy controls (n = 29), newly diagnosed RA patients (n = 29), and RA patients with remission under methotrexate (MTX) monotherapy (n = 29). Serum samples were collected and analyzed for IL-40, IL-4, TGF-β1 and TNF-α levels using ELISA. Disease activity score, presence of autoantibodies and other relevant clinical data were obtained from hospital electronic records. Elevated IL-40 levels were found in the newly diagnosed RA patients and in those treated with MTX compared to the control group (p < 0.001). Logistic regression analysis confirmed IL-40 as an independent predictor in the newly diagnosed (OR = 1.023, 95% CI: 1.010-1.035, p = 0.002) and RA MTX-treated patients (OR = 1.023, 95% CI: 1.011-1.036, p < 0.001). IL-40 levels remained unchanged in the newly diagnosed RA group compared to RA patients in the MTX-treated group. In the dual-seropositive patients, TGF-β1 was lower in the MTX-treated RA patients compared to the naive patients (p = 0.013) and in the dual-seronegative patients, TNF-α was decreased in the MTX-treated RA patients in comparison to naive patients (p = 0.043). This study demonstrates that IL-40 levels are elevated in RA patients and highlights its potential role in RA. The fact that IL-40 levels did not change despite the antiinflammatory effects of MTX suggests that IL-40 is involved in immunological pathways that are less responsive to treatment."
"This study investigated the association between <i>AIM2</i> cg11003133 DNA methylation and Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA), evaluating its diagnostic potential for RA and subtypes. MethylTarget™ sequencing targeted <i>AIM2</i> cg11003133 (chr1:159076528-159076740) in RA, Ankylosing Spondylitis (AS), Psoriatic Arthritis (PsA), gout, Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE), Dermatomyositis (DM), primary Sjögren's Syndrome (SS), and Healthy Controls (HC) patients. Logistic regression, random forest, and XGBoost models were applied, with Spearman's correlation used to assess associations. RA and RF/CCP-positive patients showed significantly higher methylation at cg11003133_79/91 compared to HC and AS (FDR < 0.05), but lower levels compared to DM. Methylation at cg11003133_139 was elevated in RA compared to AS/SS (FDR = 0.04/0.03). Anti- TNF-α non-responders had higher cg11003133_79/91 methylation levels compared to HC/AS non-responders (FDR < 0.05). RF-negative RA patients had higher cg11003133_91 methylation than AS patients who failed anti-TNF-α treatment (FDR < 0.05). Haplotype CCCC correlated positively with CRP (r = 0.14, P = 0.006); TTTT was significantly negatively correlated with erythrocyte sedimentation rate, CRP, and the presence of diabetes (r = -0.18, -0.15, and -0.14; P < 0.001, 0.003, and 0.008, respectively). XGBoost and RF models achieved AUCs of 0.9911 and 0.9975 for RA versus non-RA, and 1 for RF/CCP double-negative versus double-positive RA. <i>AIM2</i> cg11003133 methylation is strongly linked to RA, aligning with its role in inflammasome activation. While promising for diagnostics, larger validation is needed. <i>AIM2</i> cg11003133 methylation may serve as a diagnostic biomarker for RA and subtypes."
"Musculoskeletal disorders (MSDs), including osteoarthritis (OA), rheumatoid arthritis (RA), osteoporosis (OP), and intervertebral disc degenerative disease (IVDD), are among the most common and serious health problems worldwide. However, despite extensive research, drug therapy for these diseases remains a major challenge. This is likely due to a poor understanding of the underlying mechanisms. Recent evidence suggests that the development of these MSDs is associated with protein dysregulation and ongoing chronic inflammation. Protein turnover is controlled by the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS), in which E3 ubiquitin ligases, including tripartite motif proteins (TRIMs), are responsible for substrate specificity. Since multiple TRIMs are involved in the development of MSDs, their targeting may be used to correct impaired protein turnover. The recent development of targeted protein degradation technologies has revolutionized drug discovery by selectively degrading specific proteins using the UPS. It is hypothesized that failure to resolve chronic inflammation plays a critical role in the development of MSDs, suggesting that its successful resolution will result in the alleviation of MSD-related symptoms. The process of inflammation resolution is enabled by specialized pro-resolving mediators (SPMs), which are enzymatically generated from dietary essential polyunsaturated fatty acids. Supplementation with SPMs or their stable, small-molecule receptor mimetics and agonists has shown beneficial effects in MSD animal models. In this review, we substantiate the idea that the combined use of TRIM-targeting drugs and inflammation-resolving compounds represents a promising new therapeutic approach to mitigate OA, RA, OP, and IVDD manifestations and improve patient outcomes. METHODS: Aligning with the primary objectives of this review, we used a narrative-style review design to explore and critically analyze the potential links between TRIMs, chronic inflammation, and musculoskeletal disorders. Articles included in this review were identified through literature searches using PubMed (English-language original and review articles published until May 2025). The following search terms were used considering all possible combinations: ""TRIM proteins"", ""ubiquitin proteasome system"", ""ubiquitin ligases"", ""targeted protein degradation"", ""proteolytic targeting chimeras"", ""molecular glues"", ""musculoskeletal disorders"", ""osteoarthritis"", ""rheumatoid arthritis"", ""osteoporosis"", ""intervertebral disc degenerative disease"", ""chronic inflammation"", ""inflammation resolution"", ""specialized pro-resolving mediators"". Search results were supplemented by reviewing reference citations from the articles identified in the initial searches and drawing on the authors' familiarity with the published literature."
"This study of telemedicine aims to clarify the needs and issues of patients with rheumatic diseases and the medical personnel involved in their care. A questionnaire survey, targeting members of the Japan Rheumatology Association and pertinent patients/companions, was conducted on the use of telemedicine in this field. Questionnaires were collected from 351 internists, 133 orthopaedists, and 144 patients/their companions. According to the medical personnel, 77.5% and 58.6% of their patients require ≥1 h one-way travel to a medical institution, respectively. Among the patients, 28.5% and 19.5% were treated from remote areas or islands, and 52.1% and 38.3% were treated from areas with a shortage of specialized medical care. Meanwhile, a positive view of remote medical care was held by 67.2% of internists, 54.9% of orthopaedists, and 73.0% of patients/their companions. Medical personnel who treat patients from remote islands and in areas with a shortage of specialized medical care were especially open to performing remote medical care via telemedicine systems. Medical personnel expressed concerns about the quality of medical care, while the patients expressed concerns about reduced communication. This study reveals some of the concerns of medical personnel and patients with rheumatic diseases about telemedicine."
"We need screening for RA patients at high risk of RA-ILD to prevent the associated decrease in life quality and survival. The proposed screenings disagree regarding the anti-citrullinated protein antibodies (ACPA) because of their inconsistent association across recent studies. Therefore, we hypothesized that meta-analysis of the published reports should reveal clues explaining the heterogeneity of results, helping us progress in RA-ILD early detection. We aimed to discover the factors accounting for the variability of the ACPA association in the published reports. We searched the Web of Science and PubMed databases for studies reporting ACPA in RA-ILD and RA-control groups. The identified studies were analyzed using meta-analysis and meta-regression to identify moderators of the ACPA association. We found 513 unique records, containing 31 eligible data sets. The meta-analysis preceding the search for moderators showed a remarkable heterogeneity (p<sub>Q</sub> = 5.7 × 10<sup>-7</sup>). Appropriate tests showed that it was largely attributable (58.1%) to an outlier study, which had recruited cases and controls in different place and time contexts. The exclusion of this outlier from subsequent analyses did not completely remove heterogeneity (p<sub>Q</sub> = 0.004). However, it permitted the identification of the patient classification method as a significant moderator: The 14 studies using chest CT showed stronger ACPA association with RA-ILD (OR = 3.05 [95%CI: 2.12-4.38]) than the 16 employing multifactorial criteria (1.55 [95%CI: 1.18-2.03]; p = 0.0047 for the contrast). This moderator accounted for the significant heterogeneity (p<sub>Q</sub> = 0.079), was robust in sensitivity analyses, and was the only one found. Our results validate the ACPA association with RA-ILD, reinforce the importance of study design, and suggest the need to consider if studies relying on chest CT for classification could be more fruitful in the search for RA-ILD biomarkers."
"While risk factors for difficult-to-treat rheumatoid arthritis (D2TRA) have been studied in recent years, no studies have determined if there are differences between early and late developers of D2TRA. This study investigates whether patients can be classified by time to D2TRA development and examines risk factors for earlier onset. Observational study involving D2TRA patients whose reason for switching b/tsDMARD therapy was inefficacy (D2TRA-Inneficacy). Demographic data, comorbidities and disease characteristics, acute phase reactants and Disease Activity Score-28 [DAS28-ESR]) at baseline and 6 months after initiation of the first b/tsDMARD, and duration of each treatment were recorded. Using LASSO (Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator) Cox-regression feature-selection strategy, we identified those factors influencing the time to D2TRA-Inneficacy. DBSCAN clustering was conducted to identify subgroups based on time to D2TRA. Finally, we used ROC and Precision-Recall curves in tandem with the Youden index to establish a cutoff point for differentiating early and late-D2TRA. Of the 131 patients with D2TRA, 96 (72.7%) were classified as D2TRA-inefficacy. The variables presence of anxiety-depressive syndrome (ADS) at first b/tsDMARD, CRP at 6 months after starting the first b/tsDMARD and age at disease diagnosis were selected based on their contracted scores from the LASSO Cox-regression model, following the criterion of minimizing the cross-validated error. DBSCAN clustering based on selected variables identified three clusters. These clusters, differentiated by time to D2TRA, classified patients into early and late D2TRA groups. Finally, an optimal cut-off point of 44.5 months was determined using the Youden index to distinguish between the two groups. In our cohort, the cut-off time for defining early developers of D2TRA-inefficacy was 44.5 months. The presence of ADS diagnosis, a higher CRP 6 months after the first b/tsDMARD, and being older at diagnosis were predictors of early development of D2TRA."
"In rheumatoid arthritis (RA) autoantibodies can trigger complement activation in the joint, contributing to tissue damage. Complement inhibitory drugs have shown important benefit in other clinical conditions. However, their use is limited because these drugs act systemically, not only requiring high doses but also rendering patients more susceptible to infections. Therefore, we designed a strategy to only inhibit complement locally, while leaving the systemic complement system intact to fight infections. We designed bispecific antibodies (bsAbs) using controlled Fab-arm exchange. In these bsAbs, one antibody arm binds to a specific disease-relevant antigen, like carbamylated proteins, while the other arm recruits endogenous complement regulators, like factor H (FH) or C4b-binding protein (C4BP). These bsAbs were subsequently evaluated for their specificity and complement regulator recruiting capacity. We generated anti-carbamylated protein antibody (anti-CarP)-based bsAbs and confirmed specificity for carbamylated proteins. The bsAbs efficiently recruited FH or C4BP to surfaces containing carbamylated proteins. The bsAbs inhibited complement activation induced by immunoglobulin G immune complexes and more importantly, the bsAbs were able to inhibit complement activation triggered by anti-CarP antibodies from RA patients to background levels. This study shows that bsAbs that bind carbamylated proteins and FH or C4BP can specifically recruit the endogenous complement regulatory proteins from plasma to achieve selective local targeted complement inhibition, providing a new therapeutic approach for the local treatment of autoimmune diseases."
"Millions of people are affected worldwide by autoimmune disorders, including rheumatoid arthritis, lupus, multiple sclerosis and others, whose immune attacks also do not occur in a straightforward or stable manner. Dynamic changes of disease progression and treatment efficacy are not regularly monitored or diagnosed using conventional diagnostic and monitoring techniques. Wearable biosensors (WBS) provide a transformational solution for continuous, minimally invasive biomarker monitoring including cytokines, autoantibodies and acute phase proteins. This paper reviews the pathophysiology underlying WBS in autoimmune disease management, the relevant biomarkers, and the recent advances in biosensor technology. Sensitivity, specificity, stability and biocompatibility issues have also been addressed. Towards the future, our vision includes future prospects in big data analytics and artificial intelligence for predictive modeling, material science advancements for improving sensor performance, noninvasive monitoring technologies, and omics integration for a complete health status of the patient. These innovations have the ability to affect patients suffering from autoimmune disease in a personalized, data driven, and real time manner."
"Macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF), a multifunctional cytokine that plays a central role in immune regulation and tissue homeostasis, is expressed by nearly all cell types in the body. Beyond its well‑established pro‑inflammatory functions, MIF also exerts protective effects in several physiological processes. MIF enhances immune defense by activating macrophages, promoting cytokine release and supporting efficient antigen presentation. Additionally, MIF contributes to tissue repair, neuroprotection, cardiac function and metabolic regulation, facilitating epithelial healing, maintaining redox balance and modulating insulin secretion. MIF signals through multiple receptors, including CD74, CD44, CXC motif chemokine receptor (CXCR)2, CXCR4 and CXCR7, enabling it to act across a wide range of cell types. This complex signaling network allows MIF to function as both a mediator of homeostasis and a driver of pathology, depending on the biological context. Elevated MIF levels and polymorphisms such as ‑794 CATT5‑8 and ‑173G>C have been associated with increased susceptibility to and the severity of autoimmune disorders (such as systemic lupus erythematosus, multiple sclerosis and rheumatoid arthritis), cancer (such as breast, lung and colorectal cancer) and other inflammatory diseases. MIF promotes tumor progression, immune evasion and glucocorticoid resistance, positioning it as a potential biomarker and therapeutic target. Therapeutic strategies targeting MIF, such as small‑molecule inhibitors, receptor antagonists and proteolysis‑targeting chimeras, have shown promise in preclinical studies. However, translating these strategies into clinical therapies requires a deeper understanding of the tissue‑specific functions of MIF and the long‑term consequences of its modulation. Future research should focus on elucidating the mechanisms underlying the dual roles of MIF in health and disease, the impact of genetic variations and the development of targeted interventions that preserve its protective functions while minimizing its pathogenic potential. Such insights will be essential for advancing MIF‑based therapies in precision medicine."
"Fibroblast‑like synoviocytes (FLSs) are the primary drivers of synovial tissue hyperplasia in rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Activation of the tumor necrosis factor‑like weak inducer of apoptosis (TWEAK)/fibroblast growth factor‑inducible immediate‑early response protein 14 (Fn14) pathway significantly contributes to the pathogenesis of RA. Kirenol (Kir), a compound with anti‑inflammatory and antirheumatic properties, has an unclear mechanism of action. To comprehensively investigate the effects and potential mechanisms of Kir on RA, the present study employed both an <i>in vitro</i> model of transforming growth factor‑β1 (TGF‑β1)‑induced human fibroblast‑like MH7A synoviocytes proliferation and an <i>in vivo</i> collagen‑induced arthritis (CIA) rat model. The effects of Kir on synovial fibroblasts were detected via flow cytometry, ELISA, hematoxylin and eosin staining, safranin‑O/fast green staining, immunohistochemistry, immunofluorescence and western blotting. Kir ameliorated pathological damage in the synovial tissue of CIA rats, suppressed rheumatoid factor production, regulated the T helper 17 cells/regulatory T cell balance and mitigated joint inflammation and swelling. Additionally, Kir markedly downregulated the protein levels of the TWEAK/Fn14 pathway in synovial tissue. Surface plasmon resonance demonstrated that Kir could specifically bind to Fn14. Kir significantly suppressed the TGF‑β1‑mediated aberrant proliferation and migration of MH7A cells. However, the overexpression of Fn14 reversed the inhibitory effects of Kir on the abnormal proliferation and migration of cells, as did the activation of the TWEAK/Fn14 pathway. These results suggest that Kir possesses anti‑RA properties by inhibiting abnormal immune‑inflammatory responses, as well as synovial cell proliferation and migration. These effects of Kir may be linked to a decrease in the activity of the TWEAK/Fn14 pathway."
"The treatment approach to RA has changed over time, but the main goal of treatment has remained the same, that is, achieving disease remission. Given the lack of RA disease activity tools and biomarkers that can reliably predict RA drug effectiveness not just on joints but also on extra-articular manifestations. The involvement of galectins, especially Galectin-1 (Gal1) in the regulation of immune regulation makes them potential good candidate non-specific biomarkers of autoimmune diseases like RA. Examining the possibility of applying Gal1 as a potential biomarker for evaluating the effectiveness of therapy. A quasi-experimental study was conducted to assess changes in serum Gal1 concentrations in patients with RA, compared with a healthy control group. The study included a total of 88 participants, consisting of 48 patients diagnosed with RA and 40 healthy voluntary blood donors. Patients were enrolled in the study based on a selective recruitment process, provided they met the criteria outlined in the Inclusion Criteria section. The diagnosis of RA was established by physicians in accordance with the ACR/EULAR2010 classification criteria. The collected samples were subjected to concentration determination using a commercial ELISA kit for human Gal1. The serum Gal1 concentration of the examined groups differed significantly (<i>P</i> < 0.0001). There was a significant difference in serum concentration of Gal1 between first and second measurement (pre- and post-intervention) (<i>P</i> = 0.015). The obtained values of post-intervention Gal1 did not show a positive correlation with the values of DAS28-ESR, HAQ-DI, and CDAI. The conducted study showed a pronounced statistical significance in the values of Gal1 concentrations in RA patients (in both time points) compared to the group of healthy subjects, suggesting that lower levels of this marker may be associated with the degree of inflammation characteristic of RA. No significant correlation was observed between Gal1 levels and clinical disease activity indices, limiting conclusions."
"Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is one complex chronic autoimmune disease, resulting body pain and badly affect the health of RA patients. Zinc finger and BTB domain containing 16 (ZBTB16) has been reported to participate into many diseases including osteoarthritis and osteoporosis. To verify the regulatory functions of ZBTB16 in RA progression keep dimness. The mRNA expressions were tested through RT-qPCR. The protein expressions were evaluated through western blot. The pathological changes of synovial tissues were determined through HE staining. The erosion and destruction of bone tissues were examined through safranin-O/fast green staining. The levels of TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6 and MMP-3 were testified through ELISA. The fluorescence intensity of proteins was assessed through IF assay. Firstly, it was uncovered that ZBTB16 expression was markedly reduced in the synovium tissues of RA patients through analyzing GSE55235 expression profile by GEO2R online tool. Next, ZBTB16 expression was down-regulated in synovial tissues of RA patients. Moreover, ZBTB16 can alleviate the degree of paw swelling in CIA mice. ZBTB16 improved the pathological changes of synovial tissues in CIA mice. The levels of inflammatory factors and matrix metalloproteinase were increased in CIA mice, but these impacts were reversed after ZBTB16 amplification. ZBTB16 can relieve pannus in CIA mice. Besides, the triggered GRK2/HIF-1α pathway in CIA mice can be retarded after ZBTB16 overexpression. ZBTB16 exerted anti-angiogenic effects in RA by blocking GRK2/HIF-1α pathway. This work hinted that ZBTB16 may be one useful target for RA treatment."
"Although neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) are recognized as key contributors to rheumatoid arthritis (RA) progression, their immunomodulatory effects on T follicular helper (Tfh) cell differentiation remain enigmatic. Based on the effect of NETs on RA fibroblast-like synoviocytes (RA-FLSs), our study is aimed at investigating the effect of NETs on Tfh cell differentiation in RA. Immunofluorescence, western blotting, and flow cytometry were used to investigate whether NETs mediated the inflammatory phenotype transformation of synovium fibroblasts to produce IL-6 and promote Tfh cell differentiation through TLR9/MyD88/NF-κB pathway. The expressions of Cit H3, MPO, TLR9, and Bcl-6 in the synovial tissues of the trauma control group and the RA group were analyzed by immunohistochemistry. Our findings indicated that the plasma concentrations of IL-6 and MPO-DNA in RA patients were positively correlated with the level of IL-21 in lymphocytes and the proportion of circulating T follicular helper cells in peripheral blood. Further analysis revealed that NETs mediate the release of IL-6 from RA-FLSs through the TLR9/MyD88/NF-κB pathway, thereby inducing the differentiation of CD4 + T cells into Tfh cells and promoting the development of adaptive immunity in RA. This study demonstrated that NETs promoted Tfh cell differentiation by inducing IL-6 production by synovial fibroblasts through the TLR9/MyD88/NF-κB pathway. Targeting TLR9 may be a potential target for the treatment of RA. Key Points • NETs promoted Tfh cell differentiation by inducing IL-6 production by synovial fibroblasts through the TLR9/MyD88/NF-κB pathway. • Targeting TLR9 may be a potential target for the treatment of RA."
"Although studies have shown that patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) are at a higher risk of developing myasthenia gravis (MG), the causal relationship and shared genetic basis between these two diseases have not been fully investigated. The purpose of this study is to uncover the potential bidirectional causality between RA and MG, and to explore their shared genetic factors and possible pathogenic mechanisms. First, we utilized genome-wide association (GWAS) data from the IEU Open GWAS project, employing the online analysis platform MRBASE and applying four Mendelian randomization (MR) methods (Inverse Variance Weighted regression, Weighted Median, MR-Egger, and Weighted Mode) to explore the bidirectional causal relationship between RA and MG. Subsequently, we extracted transcriptomic data for RA and MG from the GEO database and used differential expression analysis, weighted gene coexpression network analysis (WGCNA), machine learning, and gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) to identify key hub genes and their associated pathways. Furthermore, we employed the CIBERSORT method to analyze the immune cell infiltration in both diseases. Ultimately, based on these identified hub genes, we constructed a diagnostic model-nomogram-to aid in the diagnosis and prediction of the diseases. RA is significantly associated with an increased risk of MG (Odds Ratio [OR]: 1.353, 95% Confidence Interval [CI]: 1.081 to 1.693, P = 0.008). However, there is insufficient evidence to support the hypothesis that MG increases the risk of RA. Through differential expression analysis and WGCNA methods, we collectively identified 18 key shared genes. Further, using two machine learning approaches, we ultimately identified 4 core hub genes (CDC42EP2, FKBP5, CD79A, and TDP1), which have great value in the diagnosis of RA and MG and are closely related to immune cell infiltration. Our study has unveiled the bidirectional causality between RA and MG, and identified shared molecular characteristics, highlighting the potential for developing targeted therapeutic strategies. Key Points • Our study shows a significant link between RA and increased MG risk, suggesting a bidirectional causal relationship. • We identified 18 key shared genes between RA and MG through differential expression and WGCNA, and pinpointed 4 core hub genes (CDC42EP2, FKBP5, CD79A, TDP1) using several machine learning algorithms. These genes are valuable for diagnosis and associated with immune cell infiltration. • We developed a diagnostic nomogram based on the hub genes, which could aid in diagnosing and predicting RA and MG, guiding clinical practice and personalized medicine."
"Cavitary pulmonary nodules (CPN) represent a rare but clinically relevant manifestation of rheumatoid arthritis (RA), yet their radiological and serological predictors remain poorly defined. This study aimed to identify key clinical, immunological, and imaging features associated with CPN among RA patients presenting with pulmonary nodules (PN). This retrospective cohort included 156 RA patients with PN identified on thoracic computed tomography between 2010 and 2024. Clinical data, autoantibody status, treatment characteristics, and radiological parameters were compared between patients with and without CPN. CPN were detected in 9.0% (n = 14) of cases. Compared to patients without CPN, affected individuals had a significantly greater number of nodules, larger nodule diameters, and higher seropositivity for rheumatoid factor, anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide antibodies, and ANCA. The largest nodule diameter was the only independent predictor of cavitary transformation (OR: 1.59, 95% CI: 1.19-2.12; p = 0.002), with stronger effect sizes in penalized regression (OR: 6.69 per SD; 95% CI: 3.52-12.61). Despite limited sample size, ROC analysis identified an optimal cut-off of 18 mm, yielding excellent discriminative performance (AUC: 0.979; sensitivity: 92.9%, specificity: 95.8%), further supported by bootstrap validation. No significant differences in baseline treatments were observed, though greater variability in drug exposure and post-diagnostic therapy adjustments was noted in CPN-positive patients. Radiological morphology-particularly increased nodule size-alongside autoantibody positivity, are key correlates of cavitary transformation in RA-associated PN. These findings support the use of imaging-based risk stratification and highlight the need for prospective validation across broader RA populations. Key Points • CPN were detected in 9% of RA patients with PN on CT imaging • Larger PN diameter emerged as the principal independent predictor of cavitary transformation, with an18 mm cut-off providing high discriminative capacity (AUC = 0.979). • Seropositivity for RF, anti-CCP, and ANCA IFA was significantly associated with cavitation. • Greater heterogeneity in pre-diagnostic leflunomide exposure and more frequent post-diagnostictherapy modifications among CPN-positive patients suggest a dynamic and potentially treatmentinfluenceddisease pattern, possibly reflecting variability in therapeutic response over time."
"To identify and validate gene expression biomarkers of response to methotrexate (MTX) treatment in peripheral blood of children with juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) measured before starting MTX treatment. RNA sequencing was performed on sorted CD4+, CD8+, CD14+, and CD19+ cells, as well as peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) taken pre-treatment in a discovery cohort (n = 97) and 2 validation cohorts (n = 26 and n = 47, respectively) of patients with non-systemic JIA. Clinical data were recorded at baseline (timepoint 1) prior to treatment and 6 months (timepoint 2) of MTX treatment. Analysis tested the association of gene expression in specific cell types with treatment response using limma-voom, gene set enrichment analysis, and a novel 51-gene score against response to treatment. Parallel analysis, also using pre-treatment gene expression data, was performed in adult rheumatoid arthritis (RA) data (n = 240). In patients with JIA, the baseline expression of genes driven by interferon (IFN) alpha (type-I) or gamma (type-II) was associated with response to treatment at 6 months in 3 independent JIA cohorts. The direction of the association indicated that children with higher baseline expression of IFN-stimulated genes prior to MTX were more likely to be good responders. Comparison with adult RA indicated differences between PBMC and whole blood gene expression associations with response. In children with JIA, a high IFN-driven gene signature is associated with a better response to MTX than those with a low IFN-driven gene signature. These data could pave the way to clinically validated tools to identify those most likely to require medications in addition to MTX to control inflammation."
"Adult-onset Still's disease is a rare systemic autoinflammatory condition of unknown aetiology. It is a diagnosis of exclusion based primarily on clinical features and non-specific laboratory findings using either the Yamaguchi or Fautrel criteria. Here, we present a case of atypical adult-onset Still's disease in a young man with twice-daily fevers, night sweats and evanescent rash on his face but not enough features to meet the Yamaguchi or Fautrel criteria after extensive (but unrevealing) infectious, autoimmune and malignancy workups. He responded well to corticosteroid therapy with periodic relapses while transitioning to anti-IL1 therapy for 8 months. At a 2-year follow-up, he now remains symptom-free after stopping anti-IL1 therapy for over a year."
"Green nanotechnology offers a sustainable approach to rheumatoid arthritis (RA) therapy by enabling targeted modulation of key inflammatory markers, addressing the limitations of conventional treatments. This study explores biogenic approach to RA therapy through the one-pot green synthesis of silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) using Mitragyna parvifolia bark extract. The synthesis of AgNPs was optimized by varying parameters such as reaction temperature, time, AgNO₃ concentration, extract volume, and pH. The fabricated AgNPs were thoroughly analyzed using UV-visible spectroscopy, dynamic light scattering, Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy, Energy dispersive X-ray analysis, transmission electron microscopy, and X-ray diffraction, confirming their functional group composition, stability, nano-scale size, spherical shape and face-centered cubic structure. In vitro studies revealed that the AgNPs exhibited superior anti-inflammatory activity compared to the crude plant extract, effectively inhibiting protein denaturation and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) enzyme activity. In vivo assessments using Carrageenan-induced paw edema and Complete Freund's Adjuvant-induced arthritis models revealed significant reductions in paw swelling, inflammatory cytokines (TNF-α and IL-6), and hematological markers of inflammation. Histopathological and radiographic analyses confirmed reduced soft tissue swelling and bone erosion in AgNP-treated groups. Network pharmacology and molecular docking studies identified key phytoconstituents of M. parvifolia targeting TNF-α (PDB ID: 2AZ5) and modulating key inflammatory pathway (TNF signaling pathway). The integration of green synthesis with phytomedicine presents a promising, sustainable, and biocompatible approach to RA treatment. Our findings establish M. parvifolia-derived silver nanoparticles as a promising therapeutic strategy for RA treatment, offering a targeted, sustainable, and effective alternative to conventional therapies through their multi-target modulation of inflammatory pathways."
"C-reactive protein (CRP) is a highly conserved pentraxin, synthesized primarily in the liver, and is widely recognized as a highly sensitive biomarker for inflammation and tissue damage. While considerable research has focused on elucidating the structural and functional aspects of CRP, along with its utility as a biomarker reflecting disease severity and activity, the understanding of distinctive CRP structural isoforms is evolving. Its role is not only as a biomarker but also as a regulator of both physiologic and pathophysiologic processes of inflammation and autoimmune pathology. In this review, we systematically reviewed the role of CRP and its monomeric form, mCRP, in autoimmune disorders like inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), rheumatoid arthritis (RA), systemic sclerosis (SSc), and psoriasis. It investigates their impact on immune dysregulation, tissue damage, and disease progression. The review also discusses studies suggesting CRP and mCRP as potential therapeutic targets to manage inflammation and maintain immune balance in autoimmune diseases and provide insights for future research and therapeutic approaches in autoimmune disease management."
"Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a multifaced autoimmune disorder characterized by chronic joint inflammation, leading to progressive disability and significantly impacting patients' quality of life. Despite advances in treatment, finding a cure or preventing disease progression remains a major clinical challenge, underscoring the urgent need for novel therapeutic strategies. Among various pathways involved in the pathophysiology of RA, the mitogen-activated protein kinases/extracellular regulated protein kinases (MAPK/ERK) pathway is of particular importance. As the central cascade within the broader MAPK signaling pathways, MAPK/ERK plays a critical role in regulating numerous physiological and pathological processes, with a well-established and prominent involvement in RA. Unlike p38 MAPK and c-Jun-N-terminal kinase (JNK), whose role in RA have been well-documented, the specific contributions of the MAPK/ERK pathway to RA remains comprehensively unreviewed. Furthermore, the MAPK/ERK pathway does not act in isolation but interacts synergistically with other major pathways, including NF-κB, Janus kinase-signal transducer and activator of transcription (JAK/STAT), sonic hedgehog (SHH), and PI3K/AKT, which further enhance its pathological effects. This review offers a comprehensive analysis of MAPK/ERK signaling pathway, focusing on its molecular components and its contribution to RA pathophysiology. Furthermore, we explore the cross-talk between MAPK/ERK and other pathways in the context of RA, and evaluates the therapeutic potential of targeting this pathway with small molecule inhibitors, natural compounds and biomolecules. By elucidating the mechanistic role of MAPK/ERK in RA, this article aims to highlight the pathway's therapeutic relevance and provide a foundation for the developing more effective, targeted therapies for RA."
"Tofacitinib is a second-generation selective Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitor targeting the JAK1 enzyme, which is used to treat several autoimmune diseases, including rheumatoid arthritis (RA), psoriatic arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, idiopathic arthritis, and ulcerative colitis. JAKs are enzymes that play a key role in inflammatory and immune signaling pathways. The medication is particularly useful as it can be given orally. However, over time, there has been much data that links this drug with an increased risk of cardiovascular events. We present a case of a 73-year-old male with a history of RA and hypertension presenting to the hospital with typical cardiac chest pain. He was found to have ischemic EKG changes and elevated troponin levels. He then underwent cardiac catheterization, which revealed significant coronary artery disease."
"Rheumatoid arthritis can affect extra-articular organs such as the liver, and the problem of drug-induced liver injury caused by traditional antirheumatic drugs for improving the condition cannot be ignored. This study aims to investigate the therapeutic effects of resveratrol (Res) on hepatic inflammation and oxidative stress in mice with collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) and to elucidate the relationship between the regulatory mechanisms of the nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2)/Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1 (Keap1) signaling pathway. In this study, we used chicken type II collagen in combination with complete Freund's adjuvant to induce arthritis in a mouse model, and Res was administered by tube feeding to detect the serum biochemical liver function and inflammation levels, oxidative stress, and apoptosis in the livers of mice. An <i>in vitro</i> cellular model of liver inflammation and oxidative stress was established by treating mouse primary hepatocytes (MPHs) with tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>. The intrinsic mechanism of Res in attenuating hepatic inflammation and oxidative stress in CIA mice was explored by treating MPHs with an Nrf2 inhibitor and Keap1 overexpression plasmid. Res significantly reduced the levels of inflammation and oxidative stress in liver tissues of CIA mice as well as in MPHs treated with TNF-α and H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> and activated the Nrf2/Keap1 signaling pathway. Inflammation and oxidative stress levels in MPHs were exacerbated by the use of Nrf2 inhibitors and Keap1 overexpression, which promoted apoptosis. This study demonstrated the intrinsic mechanism of Res of attenuating hepatic inflammation and oxidative stress in CIA mice through the Nrf2/Keap1 pathway, which provides a new idea for finding hepatoprotective treatments for rheumatoid arthritis."
"Comorbid autoimmune disorders, including rheumatoid arthritis (RA), are common in people with multiple sclerosis (MS). Both conditions share pathogenic similarities, enabling potential overlap in treatments. While numerous disease-modifying therapies (DMT) are approved for MS and new options are under clinical trial, their effectiveness in RA varies. A PubMed literature review was conducted to evaluate the effects of approved and currently investigated MS-DMT on MS and RA and vice versa. Certain MS-DMT showed beneficial effects for RA, such as teriflunomide, anti-CD20 therapies, and cladribine, while others demonstrated no significant impact (type-I interferons, Bruton´s tyrosine kinase (BTK) inhibitors) or lacked trials (sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor modulators, glatiramer acetate). In contrast, BTK inhibitors were shown to be effective for inactive secondary progressive forms of MS, whereas secukinumab showed limited effects in relapsing MS. Concerning DMT for RA in MS, no significant benefit was observed for abatacept, and there are no trials for Janus kinase inhibitors, or interleukin-(IL)-6 receptor inhibitors (tocilizumab, sarilumab). Adverse events, including RA exacerbation, were reported for some MS-DMT like dimethyl fumarate, alemtuzumab, and natalizumab. Tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFα) inhibitors increased disease activity in MS patients. Among approved DMT for MS and RA, teriflunomide and anti-CD20 therapies are the most suitable options for moderately or highly active MS with comorbid RA. Cladribine may also be considered, while TNFα inhibitors are contraindicated."
"We compared time to first remission and prevalence of sustained remission in participants with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) initiating etanercept biosimilar (ETA-B) or originator (ETA-O). We studied etanercept-naive participants with RA from four Canadian prospective cohorts who initiated ETA-B or ETA-O (Jan/2015-May/2022). Disease remission was determined using disease activity scales. Sustained remission was defined as at least two consecutive visits in remission within the first 12 months of follow-up. Multivariate Cox regression was used to compare the probability of achieving remission between ETA-B and ETA-O, and multivariate logistic regression was used to assess sustained remission. We studied 150 participants with RA (ETA-B: 65.3%). Among 125 participants not in remission at baseline, the median time to first remission was 8.7 months (95% confidence intervals [CI] 5.2-12.1) in the ETA-B group and 14.5 months (95% CI 4.7-18.6) in the ETA-O group. Time to first remission was similar between the groups (log-rank test: P-value = 0.51). Multivariate Cox regression showed no clear difference in first remission between ETA-B and ETA-O (adjusted hazard ratio 1.52, 95% CI 0.68-3.39). Among 125 participants with at least 12 months of follow-up, the prevalence of sustained remission was 19.5% for ETA-B and 21.0% for ETA-O. In multivariate analysis, we did not detect a significant difference in sustained remission between ETA-B and ETA-O (adjusted odds ratio 1.14, 95% CI 0.29-4.87). We did not detect clear differences in first remission and sustained remission between participants with RA initiating ETA-B or ETA-O. Not applicable."
"This study aimed to investigate the pattern of use and barriers for implementation of patient-reported outcomes measures (PROMs) in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) in Spain. Two-round Delphi study targeted at rheumatologists attending a PROMs training program and guided by a Scientific Committee composed of four expert rheumatologists was conducted. The survey assessed the current use, appropriateness, and feasibility of 7 PROMs proposed by the International Consortium for Health Outcomes Measurements (ICHOM). Barriers to implement PROMs in routine care were also explored. A 7-point Likert scale was used ranging from 1 (strongly disagree) to 7 (strongly agree). Consensus was established when > 75% reached agreement (rated 6-7 = agreement, or 1-2 = disagreement). A total of 39 rheumatologists of 120 (32%) participated {61.5% women; mean age 50.3 [standard deviation (SD) 11.0] years; mean 18.1 (9.6) years of experience; 23.1% running a RA clinic}. Although 82.1% of rheumatologists agreed on involving patients in shared decision-making (SDM), only 56.4% adopted SDM strategies in treatment decisions. A higher percentage (79.4%) agreed on the importance of incorporating PROMs, but only 28.2% recognized to use them in routine care, being the most frequently used pain on a visual analogue scale (VAS) (89.8%), the Health Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ) (71.7%), and a VAS-fatigue (66.7%). The remaining proposed PROMs by ICHOM did not reach a consensus on either appropriateness or feasibility. The main barriers found included lack of time in consultation (84.6%) and the unavailability of PROMs platforms incorporated in the electronic medical records (87.9%). Spanish rheumatologists consider PROMs useful to guide SDM in routine care being the most frequently used pain, fatigue, and physical function. However, other domains proposed by ICHOM as health-related quality of life (HRQoL) or work/school productivity are not commonly used. Promoting the use of PROMs strategies, including optimizing consultation time and incorporating PROMs into electronic medical records, is necessary."
"Pulegone, a monoterpene phytochemical, was evaluated for its anti-inflammatory and anti-arthritic properties. This study investigated its preventive efficacy against rheumatoid arthritis using in vivo animal models and in vitro assays. The in vitro analysis included the inhibition of egg albumin and bovine serum albumin (BSA) denaturation, as well as the stabilization of red blood cell membranes against hemolysis, across concentrations of 50-6400 μg/mL. For in vivo evaluation, arthritis was induced using formaldehyde and Complete Freund's Adjuvant (CFA) models, with pulegone administered at doses of 20, 40, and 80 mg/kg. The mRNA expression levels of key inflammatory mediators, including interleukin-1 beta (IL-1β), interleukin-17 (IL-17), nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), interleukin receptor-associated kinase (IRAK), and interleukin (IL)-10 and IL-17, were also analyzed. Results showed concentration-dependent inhibition of egg albumin and BSA denaturation, with maximum erythrocyte membrane-stabilizing effects observed at 6400 μg/mL. Pulegone exhibited dose-dependent anti-arthritic activity in the formaldehyde model, with the highest efficacy at 80 mg/kg. In the CFA model, pulegone significantly reduced arthritic lesions, mitigated weight loss, reversed hematological and biochemical abnormalities, and improved radiographic and histopathological outcomes. Additionally, pulegone demonstrated potent antioxidant effects in superoxide dismutase and reducing power assays. Treatment with pulegone significantly reduced pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-1β, TNF-α, IRAK, and NF-κB) while increasing anti-inflammatory cytokines (IL-10 and IL-17) compared to the control group. In conclusion, pulegone effectively suppressed inflammatory responses in rheumatoid arthritis by modulating cytokine levels and enhancing antioxidant activity, making it a promising candidate for therapeutic development."
"Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a systemic inflammatory disorder frequently associated with sarcopenia, a gradual decline in skeletal muscle mass and strength. Hand sarcopenia in RA leads to functional deterioration and diminished quality of life. Although conventional methods, such as exercise and nutrition, are typically used, current evidence suggests that massage therapy may offer advantages through anti-inflammatory, circulatory, and anabolic pathways. This hypothesis-driven article proposes that targeted hand massage may alleviate sarcopenia in RA by enhancing local perfusion, modulating immunological responses, mitigating oxidative stress, and stimulating muscle-regenerative pathways. Experimental investigations in animals and humans have demonstrated that massage can activate mechanotransduction signaling, enhance muscle protein synthesis, stimulate satellite cell activity, and reduce inflammatory mediators, including tumor necrosis factor-alpha and interleukin-6. Moreover, enhancements in handgrip strength and muscle oxygenation have been documented after mechanical interventions. Small sample sizes, diverse methodologies, and the absence of standardized massage procedures limit the clinical validity of the data. Randomized controlled trials involving RA patients with compromised hand function and sarcopenia are necessary to explore this hypothesis. Standardized outcome measures, such as handgrip strength, disease activity scores, muscle tissue imaging, and inflammatory biomarkers, are required to assess efficacy. If verified, massage therapy may provide a non-invasive, low-risk complement to established care, potentially enhancing muscle function and quality of life in RA patients with sarcopenia."
"Rheumatoid arthritis is a common autoimmune disease characterized by chronic synovial inflammation and joint destruction, primarily driven by an imbalanced cellular metabolism and inflammatory microenvironment. While gene therapy offers a promising therapeutic approach, its effectiveness is limited by the challenges of non-specific gene expression in healthy tissues. Here, we develop a gene delivery system (namely APPC), in which near-infrared (NIR)-responsive gold nanorods are coated with chondroitin sulfate-modified polyethyleneimine to facilitate the heat-responsive targeted delivery of heme oxygenase 1 (HO-1) gene. The APPC shows favorable transfection efficiency due to its targeting ability and significantly facilitates HO-1 expression under NIR irradiation. The combination of APPC/pHO-1 and NIR can effectively reprogram the cellular metabolism and repolarize the macrophages and fibroblast-like synoviocytes, thereby inhibiting inflammation by suppressing glycolysis. Meanwhile, APPC can specifically enhance the HO-1 expression in inflamed tissues through NIR-mediated the activation of heat shock protein 70 promoter, ensuring the precise gene expression via photothermal conversion. In a collagen-induced arthritis model, APPC/pHO-1 under NIR irradiation exhibits potent therapeutic efficacy, restoring the articular microenvironmental homeostasis and mitigating the symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis. These findings highlight the potential of APPC/pHO-1 nanoparticles in the gene therapy of rheumatoid arthritis and other inflammatory diseases."
"Temporomandibular joint (TMJ) involvement is a common yet under-recognized manifestation of Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis (JIA) which can impair craniofacial growth and oral function. While early functional orthopaedic intervention holds promise, evidence from long-term studies evaluating outcomes and predictors of treatment response remains sparse. This prospective longitudinal study included 84 children (mean age: 12.3 ± 2.1 years) diagnosed with JIA and clinical TMJ involvement. All participants were treated with a standardized modified twin-block appliance over a 2-year period. Clinical, skeletal, inflammatory and quality-of-life assessments were performed at six time points using Maximum Interincisal Opening (MIO), Visual Analog Scale (VAS) for pain, cephalometry (SNB angle), C-reactive protein (CRP), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), autoantibodies (RF, ANA, anti-CCP), cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) and the OHIP-14 questionnaire. Prognostic factors and relapse were evaluated using multivariate regression and Kaplan-Meier survival analysis. Over 24 months, patients demonstrated statistically significant improvement in MIO (+7.6 mm), VAS pain score (-3.9), SNB angle (+3.6°), ESR (-14.7 mm/hr) and CRP (-6.9 mg/L) (p < 0.001). Poorer outcomes were associated with RF/anti-CCP positivity, elevated baseline ESR/CRP, severe TMJ changes on CBCT and extra-articular involvement. In contrast, children aged ≤12 years with overjet ≤5 mm, SNB angle ≥76° and mild radiographic findings showed better therapeutic response. The 2-year relapse-free survival rate was 63.1 %. Modified twin-block therapy appears to be a promising adjunct for managing TMJ involvement in JIA. Early intervention, mild radiographic pathology and absence of seropositivity were strong predictors of sustained improvement highlighting the need for timely diagnosis and individualized orthopaedic planning."
"Chronic systemic inflammation and autoimmunity are hallmarks of rheumatoid arthritis (RA), an inflammatory illness that gradually deteriorates the joints and results in permanent disability. An important pathogenic mechanism in RA is angiogenesis, which draws inflammatory leukocytes into the synovium and encourages the synthesis of damaging proteases and proinflammatory cytokines. High-mobility group box-1 (HMGB1) is a common nuclear protein with extracellular inflammatory ability that plays a crucial function in inflammatory disorders. Using data from the GEO dataset, the present report determined that the expression levels of HMGB1, the vascular marker CD34, and the angiogenic factor PDGF-B were remarkably higher in RA patients than in normal controls. HMGB1 treatment enhanced PDGF-B production in RA synovial fibroblasts (RASFs), while a PDGF-B antibody blocked HMGB1-treated RASFs-induced angiogenesis in HUVECs. We also revealed that the RAF, MEK, and ERK signaling pathways mediate HMGB1-induced PDGF-B production and angiogenesis. Thus, the HMGB1/PDGF-B axis may serve as a novel target for RA treatment."
"Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic, systemic, inflammatory disease. Sensitization of central pain pathways by pro-inflammatory mediators has been implicated in RA pain. Locus coeruleus (LC) functions in pain pathways. Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) participates in the modulation of nociception and pain. A mouse model of RA immunized with collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) was used for investigating the mechanisms of pain relief by administration of the tropomyosin receptor kinase B (TrkB) receptor antagonist ANA-12. We measured the pain behaviors and locomotor activity and found increased pain sensitivity and locomotor deficit in RA mice; ANA-12 treatment reduced pain behaviors and promoted locomotor function recovery. The glial activation and increased activities of BDNF/TrkB and MAPK signal pathways were found in LC of RA mice. The components of NLRP3 inflammasome were all increased and consequently enhanced the production of pro-inflammatory cytokine interleukin (IL)-1β. Upon ANA-12 treatment, glial cell activation was reduced, BDNF/TrkB and MAPK pathways were suppressed, and the expression levels of the above-mentioned proteins were reduced. Finally, U251 cells were conducted to further confirm the regulatory mechanisms of ANA-12 on inflammation. The results showed the colocalization of BDNF/NLRP3/IL-1β and GFAP. ANA-12 treatment decreased the protein levels of BDNF, TrkB, MAPK, NLRP3, and caspase-1 in IL-1β-induced cells. Besides, ANA-12 treatment decreased NLRC4 and AIM2 inflammasomes both in RA mice and IL-1β-induced cells. These results suggested that ANA-12 alleviates hyperalgesia in RA mice by inhibiting BDNF/TrkB signaling in LC, thereby reducing glial cell activation and inflammatory cytokine release."
"Macrophages play a pivotal role in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) pathogenesis. Paeoniflorin, a traditional Chinese medication, reduces inflammation by suppressing immune cell activation and inducing synovial fibroblast apoptosis, attenuating RA disease progression. Despite the potential therapeutic benefits, free paeoniflorin has limitations, including low drug utilization, poor selectivity, and short half-life during administration. We aimed to develop and evaluate dextran sulfate-modified paeoniflorin pH-responsive lipid-polymer hybrid nanoparticles (Pae-PPNPs-DS) for targeted macrophage delivery and improved treatment efficacy in RA. The pH sensitivity is attributed to the incorporation of poly(cyclohexane-1,4-dimethylene ketal), which undergoes hydrolysis-triggered degradation under acidic conditions enabling passive targeting to inflammatory sites through pH-dependent drug release. Simultaneously, dextran sulfate serves as a ligand to actively target Scavenger receptor class A type I overexpressed on activated macrophages in RA synovium, achieving dual-targeted delivery via environmental responsiveness and ligand-receptor interaction. We developed dextran sulfate-modified Pae-PPNPs-DS, which exhibits dual capabilities of active macrophage targeting and pH-triggered drug release, to deliver paeoniflorin to macrophages and improve drug delivery at the joint inflammation site. Nanoparticle characterization, in vitro release behavior, stability, macrophage uptake, macrophage polarization pathway, phenotypic polarization, and therapeutic efficacy were evaluated in a rat model of RA. Pae-PPNPs-DS had smooth surfaces, uniform particle sizes, physical stability, and pH-responsive characteristics. RAW264.7 macrophages showed enhanced Pae-PPNPs-DS uptake. Pae-PPNPs-DS effectively modulated the STAT signaling pathway and modulated macrophage polarization. Pae-PPNPs-DS inhibited the expression of <i>TNF-α</i>/<i>IL-1β</i>/<i>iNOS</i>/<i>IL-6</i> (pro-inflammatory and M1 markers), while promoting <i>IL-10</i>/<i>Arg-1</i>/<i>TGF-β</i> (anti-inflammatory and M2 markers) secretion. Pathological analysis revealed that Pae-PPNPs-DS prevented synovial tissue proliferation, inhibited inflammatory cell infiltration, and exhibited therapeutic efficacy. Pae-PPNPs-DS actively target macrophages, regulate polarization through STAT pathway, and inhibit joint inflammation, suggesting its potential in treating RA. The study highlights the potential of pH-responsive nanocarriers as an innovative approach to treating autoimmune diseases."
"Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a systemic immune-mediated disease characterized by synovitis and joint cartilage destruction. Although many studies have shown that mitophagy is crucial in the development of bone metabolism disorders, its exact function in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is still not well understood. This study analysed the GSE77298 dataset from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients and healthy controls. Mitophagy-related genes (MRGs) were extracted from the literature and screened using bioinformatics techniques, resulting in differentially expressed MRGs (DE-MRGs). The diagnostic value of these genes was assessed using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves, and an ANN model was constructed. In the GSE77298 dataset, 267 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified. Weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) identified 2191 key module genes, leading to 63 DE-MRGs. Two MRGs, TMEM45A and ZBTB25, were identified as hub genes with areas under the curve (AUC) of 0.991 and 0.911, respectively. The nomogram model demonstrated high diagnostic value. Mitophagy plays a critical role in the progression of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Identifying two genes associated with mitophagy may aid in the early diagnosis, mechanistic understanding, and treatment of RA."
"Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic systemic autoimmune disease characterized by persistent joint inflammation and progressive bone destruction. Current conventional treatments, including nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, glucocorticoids, and disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs, often fail to achieve sustained remission in many patients. Mesenchymal stem/stromal cells (MSCs) have emerged as a promising therapeutic option for RA due to their immunomodulatory and regenerative properties. However, challenges such as poor migration and homing, low survival rate, heterogeneity, and impaired potency under pathological microenvironment need to be resolved to promote the use of MSCs in the clinic in the future. This review comprehensively examines the role of MSCs and their interaction with the microenvironment in the treatment of RA. We analyze completed and ongoing clinical trials involving MSC-based therapies for RA, summarize strategies to enhance the therapeutic effect of MSCs on RA, and propose standardized parameters to optimize clinical applications. By addressing these critical aspects, this review aims to advance the development of MSC-based therapies for RA."
"Pain is one of the most debilitating sequelae of rheumatoid arthritis. Established and emerging therapies offer effective disease control for many patients, though they often have underwhelming efficacy for pain relief. The uncoupling of pain intensity from disease activity and inflammation presents an ongoing challenge in both our understanding of the pathophysiology and our ability to treat joint pain. The generation of high-parameter, unbiased -omic data sets generated from patient-derived tissues is changing how we think about rheumatoid arthritis pain. In this review, we discuss the peripheral drivers of pain in rheumatoid arthritis-affected joints and their innervating primary afferents. We evaluate how human molecular immunology and neuroscience approaches are helping us unravel the heterogeneity of pain in rheumatoid arthritis and propose future directions to clarify how pain is maintained in the absence of inflammation. Synovial fibroblasts have emerged as key pronociceptive drivers within the rheumatic joint. Further to the classical proinflammatory mediators known to drive pain, such as cytokines and prostaglandins, bone morphogenetic proteins, ephrin signaling, and netrins appear to be upregulated in both rheumatoid arthritis-affected synovium and the innervating sensory neurons. Resulting adaptations to innervating primary afferents such as synaptogenesis and neurite outgrowth may occur in a sensory neuron subtype-specific manner causing pain that is disproportionate to inflammation. Nociceptor sprouting in the joint may explain why pain tends to persist despite adequate disease control. Future mechanistic work exploring the conditions under which these nociceptors sprout into the joint will provide new therapeutic avenues for ensuring that pain resolves alongside the inflammation associated with rheumatoid arthritis."
"The Rheumatoid Arthritis Non-responders to Treatment (RANT) study (https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT05447182) uses a novel bioinformatics platform to facilitate a ""decentralized"" patient oriented clinical study. The goal is to identify genetic factors associated with inadequate response to biologic and targeted synthetic rheumatoid arthritis (RA) medications. The study was advertised through social media, research website postings, and targeted recruitment of potentially eligible patients in academic practices and existing RA research registries. Interested RA patients who failed two or more biologic or targeted synthetic RA therapies completed a self-directed online informed consent and questionnaires on RA treatment history and granted access to electronic health records through a third-party vendor. After confirming eligibility by reviewing participant responses, participants received a blood sample kit by mail, had blood sample tubes drawn locally, and returned the kit by mail to the study genomic lab for whole genome sequencing. The study enrolled 164 eligible patients. The majority of eligible participants were identified through an established RA research registry (n = 101, 61.6 %) and through clinic recruitment at academic practices (n = 47, 28.7 %). Of the participants who were mailed a blood kit, 118/130 (90.7 %) returned the kit with blood sample by mail. Clinical and genetic factors of RA treatment non-responders will be compared to RA treatment responders from established research cohorts. This study demonstrates the feasibility of decentralized patient-oriented clinical studies in medicine, and highlights the importance of ""traditional"" recruitment methods like patient registries and academic practices. Future study results will identify potential clinical and genetic predictors of treatment refractory RA."
"Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic autoimmune disease characterized by symmetric joint swelling, pain, and progressive bone destruction. Although the advent of biologic therapies has significantly improved treatment outcomes, challenges remain in early detection and timely intervention. This study utilizes a nested case-cohort design from the UK Biobank (UKB), integrating proteomics, genome-wide association studies (GWAS), and single-cell RNA sequencing data from the GEO database to systematically evaluate proteins associated with RA risk and identify novel therapeutic targets. Through Cox analysis of proteomic data from 706 RA patients and 1410 controls, we identified 440 plasma proteins. Mendelian randomization analysis further narrowed down 35 plasma proteins, and colocalization analysis ultimately confirmed strong associations and colocalization for ICAM3, CTSV, and RNASET2 in the UKB-PPP dataset. Additionally, we developed an RA risk prediction model based on plasma proteins using the XGBoost algorithm, which demonstrated moderate performance (AUC = 0.74) with a prediction window of up to 5 years in advance. Furthermore, through functional enrichment analysis, protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks, and single-cell RNA sequencing, we elucidated the biological roles and mechanisms of these proteins in RA pathogenesis, providing new strategies for identifying biomarkers and developing targeted therapies for rheumatoid arthritis."
"Fibroblast-like synoviocytes (FLSs) and synovial macrophages (SMs) contribute significantly to the occurrence and development of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Although therapeutic strategies targeting FLSs or SMs have achieved certain results, monotherapy often fails to effectively alleviate synovitis. By loading methotrexate (MTX) and glucose oxidase (GOx) in the zinc imidazole framework-8 (ZIF-8) and incorporating with the platinum nanoparticles (Pt NPs) and macrophage membranes, multifunctional probe mZPMG NPs were prepared. The mZPMG NPs can synergistically inhibit the abnormal proliferation of FLSs through drug therapy and starvation therapy, while eliminating excessive reactive oxygen species (ROS) and promoting the polarization of SMs toward M2-type macrophages. Oxygen generated through the ROS scavenging process can enhance the efficiency of the GOx starvation treatment. The in vivo experiments demonstrated that the clinical score of collagen-induced arthritis mice treated with the mZPMG NPs was 72.92% lower than those treated with PBS. Meanwhile, the mice in the mZPMG group exhibited obvious suppression of synovial hyperplasia, inflammatory infiltration, and cartilage erosion. Therefore, this study proposed to adopt a ""dual pronged attack"" strategy in inhibiting the abnormal proliferation of FLSs and reducing the abundance of SMs to achieve macrophage repolarization, which provides a promising platform for the comprehensive treatment of RA."
"to analyze the relationship between self-care and pharmacotherapy complexity in individuals with rheumatoid arthritis. this cross-sectional study was conducted at a teaching hospital in the Central-West region of Brazil from October to December 2023. Individuals with rheumatoid arthritis undergoing treatment for at least three months were included. A sociodemographic questionnaire, the Appraisal of Self-Care Agency Scale-Revised, and the Pharmacotherapy Complexity Index were used. Analytical statistics were applied using percentiles, the Shapiro-Wilk test, post hoc analysis, ANOVA, and the Kruskal-Wallis test. the sample consisted of 96 individuals. The mean self-care and pharmacotherapy complexity scores were at intermediate levels, 56.33 and 18.29, respectively. Relationships were identified between dose frequency and self-care development, as well as between overall pharmacotherapy complexity and reduced self-care capacity. a high dosage frequency may positively influence self-care development in individuals with arthritis, whereas higher pharmacotherapy complexity scores may impair self-care capacity."
"The study aims to investigate and assess the effectiveness of current novel techniques for the preparation of an efficient nanocarrier system in resolving the drawbacks associated with the delivery of herbal bioactives to treat rheumatoid arthritis. Systematic utilization of various search engines like Science Direct, Pubmed, Shodhganga, Google Scholar, and Google Patent databases based on various sets of key phrases has been performed. All the findings from these data have been studied and briefed based on their relevant and irrelevant information. The current study summarizes the existing research and development of new nano-formulations with a focus on herbal bioactive compounds for treating rheumatoid arthritis. Physicochemical properties of phytoconstituents, such as low aqueous solubility, low permeation coefficient, and chemical instability, poor bioavailability, short plasma half-life, and ultimately sub-therapeutic efficacy, limit their clinical translation despite their great potency. The utilization of Phytochemical-Based Nanocarrier Approaches for rheumatoid arthritis can be a milestone as a major population is affected by this disease worldwide. The intensive study recapitulates that novel drug delivery systems can provide new opportunities to efficiently deliver herbal bioactives with improved pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties. The exhaustive study concluded that transferosomes, ethosomes, transethosomes, niosomes, phytosomes, Solid Lipid Nanoparticles (SLN), Nano Lipid Carriers (NLC), bilosomes and hylurosomes are some of the efficient nanocarrier systems that may impart numerous benefits to the delivery of herbal bioactives for treatment of RA. These nanocarrier systems fabricated with phytoconstituents flaunt the evident promising benefits of improved aqueous solubility, low first-pass metabolism with upgraded bioavailability, sustained release action, resistance to enzymatic degradation etc., providing support in rheumatoid arthritis recovery. This review discusses that the upgradation of the pharmacological action and other relevant issues of herbal bioactives are possible by utilizing novel drug delivery systems, resulting in successful development of nano-loaded herbal bioactives. It also focuses on highlighting the pioneering progression in the field of herbal bioactives-loaded nanocarrier systems for rheumatoid arthritis both <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i> along with their advanced preparation methods and applications and discussing the opportunities for further prospects. This compiled informative review will enlighten various researchers in the field of delivering herbal bioactives for rheumatoid arthritis."
"Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA) is a chronic autoimmune disease that prominently affects the joints of the body, including one or more types, such as wrists, knees, fingers, and toes. This condition is characterized by specific auto-immune responses, i.e., inflammation, swelling, stiffness, and pain in the body's joints. This results in partial or complete immobility. Several treatment options are available in the pharmaceutical market, commonly immunosuppressants, anti-inflammatory drugs, corticosteroids, anti-antibody drugs, etc. However, such drug treatments provide only symptomatic relief and lack long-term therapeutic efficacy. Thus, there is a need to develop an alternative treatment option that potentially can cure this disease. Recently, researchers have shifted their focus to targeting the root cause involved in the pathogenesis of RA by designing nucleic-acid- based molecules. With this objective, we have provided this review in which we have explored the nucleic acid-based techniques used to treat RA. Various molecular and genetic methods, including antisense oligonucleotides, small interfering RNA (siRNA), CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing, RNA-based vaccines, microRNA (miRNA) therapeutics, and epigenetic modifications are used to target the mechanisms underlying RA pathogenesis. Through the extensive evaluation of clinical and preclinical studies, we reported nucleic acid-based therapy's clinical efficacy, safety, and therapeutic benefits. In addition, this study states the associated pharmacokinetic challenges followed by approaches to overcome them. Nucleic acid-based therapies are susceptible to degradation by nucleases in the body and are not efficiently absorbed due to their considerable molecular weight. Specialized carriers like nanoparticles are employed for their effective delivery. Nucleic acid-based therapies hold immense potential for achieving more effective, less toxic, and patient-centric management of RA, offering hope for improved outcomes and an enhanced quality of life for individuals living with this challenging autoimmune condition."
"Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA) is a chronic autoimmune disease characterized by synovial inflammation and destruction of articular cartilage and bone, which seriously affects patients' quality of life. In recent years, with the in-depth research on natural medicines, the application of polysaccharides in the treatment of RA has gradually gained attention due to their unique bioactive components and diverse pharmacological effects. Polysaccharides were reported to exert anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, immunomodulatory, and protective effects on cartilage and bone tissues. This review briefly introduces RA, its etiology and pathogenesis, and the different sources and structures of polysaccharides. It focuses on the mechanisms of polysaccharides in the alleviation of RA, mainly through the modulation of immune cell function, inhibition of inflammation, regulation of gut microbiota, promotion of bone formation and repair, and influence on related pathways. The aim of this review is to summarize the polysaccharides and their mechanisms of action in the alleviation of RA, with a view to providing new ideas for the clinical treatment of RA."
"There is a growing array of options for the treatment of immune-mediated inflammatory diseases (IMIDs). To explore upadacitinib's efficacy and safety in autoimmune disease treatment, we conducted this study. Pubmed, Web of Science and Embase were searched for randomized controlled trials related to the treatment of upadacitinib from the databases' inception to May 31, 2024. After literature screening, data extraction and bias assessment by two investigators, RevMan 5.3 or Stata 17.0 software was used for meta-analysis. 45 records across the following five types of IMIDs were obtained. For rheumatoid arthritis (RA), upadacitinib 15 mg outperformed placebo, methotrexate and adalimumab (ADA) in 20% improvement according to ACR criteria (ACR20) and 28-joint disease activity score (DAS28) (<i>P</i> < 0.05). It also improved quality of daily life based on pain relief, morning stiffness and 36-Item Short Form Health Survey, etc. For axial spondyloarthritis (axSpA), upadacitinib 15 mg enhanced 20/40% improvement in Assessment of SpondyloArthritis international Society (Risk Ratio [RR] = 1.28/1.47), with better rates of low disease activity and inactive disease as well. For psoriatic arthritis (PsA), upadacitinib 15 mg or 30 mg significantly improved ACR20 compared to placebo (RR = 2.46/2.68, <i>P</i> < 0.001) and reduced psoriasis skin lesions, though it showed no superior benefit for enthesitis compared to placebo. For Crohn's disease (CD), upadacitinib 45 mg significantly improved stool frequency and abdominal pain score clinical remission compared to placebo (RR = 2.47, 95% CI [2.12, 2.88], <i>P</i> < 0.001) as well as Crohn's Disease Activity Index score remission and endoscopic response (<i>P</i> < 0.001). For ulcerative colitis (UC), upadacitinib 45 mg increased clinical remission rates (RR = 6.92, 95% CI [4.99, 9.59], <i>P</i> < 0.001) and improved symptoms like bowel frequency and abdominal pain (<i>P</i> < 0.05). Overall adverse events (AEs) rates were generally similar to non-upadacitinib groups (RR = 1.02, 95% CI [0.98, 1.07]). However, the higher risks of infections especially herpes zoster (HZ) must be highlighted in upadacitinib group. Although the incidence of death, serious adverse events (SAEs), and long-term risks like cardiovascular events and malignancies were without statistic significant differences, careful monitoring during treatment would still be essential. Upadacitinib is effective in treating IMIDs like RA, axSpA, PsA, CD, and UC. Though well-tolerated generally, its safety in infection especially HZ needs caution. Thorough assessment, monitoring and individualized dosing are vital to manage potential AEs. https://www.crd.york.ac.uk/prospero/, identifier CRD42024569370."
"Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic autoimmune disease that significantly compromises patient quality of life due to its high prevalence and risk of disability. While its etiology remains incompletely understood, increasing evidence highlights the critical involvement of epigenetic mechanisms, particularly post-translational modifications (PTMs), in RA pathogenesis. Advances in proteomics have identified various PTMs-including phosphorylation, methylation, acetylation, ubiquitination, glycosylation, lactylation, as well as citrullination and carbamylation-as key regulators of inflammation, immune response, and tissue remodeling in RA. Importantly, dysregulated PTMs may alter protein structure and function, thereby contributing to disease progression. This review systematically summarizes current knowledge on the roles and mechanisms of major PTMs in RA, with a special focus on the cross-talk between PTMs, their interaction with non-coding RNAs, and the emerging therapeutic potential of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) targeting PTMs. These insights may provide novel perspectives for the diagnosis and treatment of RA."
"Severe mental disorders have been linked to immune system dysfunction. While a genetic association between mental disorders and autoimmune diseases has been suggested, their genetic relationship remains incompletely understood. Utilizing a complementary set of statistical analyses, we conducted a comprehensive investigation of the genetic architecture between severe mental disorders (major depression (MD), bipolar disorder (BD), and schizophrenia (SCZ)) and seven autoimmune diseases (autoimmune thyroiditis, celiac disease, inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), multiple sclerosis, psoriasis, rheumatoid arthritis, and type 1 diabetes), involving a total of 667,518 cases from 10 genome-wide association studies. While MD was positively genetically correlated with five autoimmune diseases, BD and SCZ were only positively correlated with IBD, suggesting differences in the genetic signal shared with autoimmunity across these mental disorders. A considerable fraction of genetic variants influencing autoimmune diseases (range 17.1-88.4 %) were estimated to overlap with mental disorders; however, this constitutes only a minor part of genetic variants influencing the more polygenic mental disorders. Finally, we identified 172 genetic loci jointly affecting mental disorders and autoimmune diseases, implicating both lipid metabolism and TNF signaling. In conclusion, MD, BD, and SCZ have a small but distinct genetic overlap with autoimmune diseases, which may inform new possible immune targets for treatment in mental illness."
"Previous studies have identified synovial T cells as key pathogenic drivers of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). To explore a novel therapeutic strategy targeting these cells, we aimed to develop mesenchymal stem cell-derived exosomes with enhanced PD-L1 expression (Exo-PD-L1) and evaluate their therapeutic potential in RA. Mouse bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) were stimulated with interferon γ (IFN-γ) to upregulate programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression. Exo-PD-L1 was isolated and administered to collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) model mice. Therapeutic effects were assessed through T cell activity assays, in vivo biodistribution tracking, clinical symptom scoring, and histopathological analysis of extremities and major organs. Exo-PD-L1 significantly inhibited the activity of cultured T cells, was highly concentrated in the joints of RA mice, and significantly improved RA manifestations and histological abnormalities in the extremities of mice. No histological abnormalities were observed in the main organs of the mice. Exo-PD-L1 can be homed to inflammatory lesions and have the potential to treat RA."
"Leucine-rich alpha-2-glycoprotein 1 (LRG1) was previously reported to regulate inflammation and arthritis progression. This study aimed to investigate the correlation of serum LRG1 level with disease features and response to biologics in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients. Seventy-eight RA patients who underwent biologics treatment were analyzed. Serum LRG1 level was detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay at baseline (before biologics were initiated) and at weeks 6 and 12. Treatment response, low disease activity (LDA), and remission were analyzed on the basis of disease activity score in 28 joints. Moreover, serum LRG1 level in another 20 health controls was also analyzed. LRG1 was greater in RA patients than in health controls (46.3 versus 28.6 µg/mL, P < 0.001), with an area under the curve of 0.795 for differentiating them according to the receiver operator characteristic curve. By correlation analysis, LRG1 was correlated with a greater body mass index (P = 0.007) and C-reactive protein level (P = 0.013) in RA patients and tended to be associated with swollen joint count but was not statistically significant (P = 0.052). Furthermore, LRG1 decreased from baseline to week 12 after biologics treatment in RA patients (P < 0.001). However, baseline LRG1 was not correlated with treatment response (P = 0.987), LDA (P = 0.405), or remission (P = 0.763) in RA patients. A decrease in LRG1 at week 12 (P = 0.028) was related to response achievement, and a decrease in LRG1 at week 6 (P = 0.047) and week 12 (P = 0.019) was related to LDA achievement. LRG1 may aid in RA disease supervision, but further validation is needed. Key Points • LRG1 level can distinguish RA patients from health controls with a high AUC at 0.795. • LRG1 level is correlated with higher BMI and CRP level, and tends to be related to elevated SJC in RA patients. • LRG1 level after treatment is correlated with clinical response and LDA to biologics in RA patients, while its level before treatment fails to do so. • Collectively, LRG1 level shows a potential to be a biomarker for RA disease supervision."
"The study aimed to evaluate the incidence rate and potential risk factors of malignancies in Japanese patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). This retrospective observational study analyzed data of adult patients with RA from April 2013 to March 2019 using the NinJa database. Patients were categorized into the overall RA cohort and sub-cohorts: biologic disease-modifying antirheumatic drug (bDMARDs) or Janus kinase inhibitors (JAKi-s)-exposed, bDMARDs exposed, and bDMARDs or JAKi-s naïve conventional synthetic DMARDs exposed. The incidence of overall and each type of malignancy was calculated, and the associated risk factors were analyzed using multivariate logistic regression. Overall, 26 607 patients were included in the overall RA cohort (mean age: 64.16 ± 13.29 years; female: 78.87%) with 1018 malignancies. The incidence of malignancies was similar to that in the general population, with a standardized incidence ratio (SIR) of 0.97 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.91-1.03). It was consistent across the sub-cohorts and each year. The most frequent malignancies were lung cancer (n = 158), lymphoma (n = 151) and colorectal cancer (n = 145). The incidence of lymphoma and skin cancer was higher than the general population, with SIRs of 4.00 (3.39-4.68) and 1.70 (1.25-2.30), respectively. Multivariate analysis showed older age, male sex, smoking, Steinbrocker stage score 2 versus 1, 4 versus 1, and higher Disease Activity Score 28 using C-reactive protein as potential risk factors for malignancies. Japanese patients with RA did not have an elevated risk of overall malignancies, whereas the incidence of lymphoma and skin cancer was higher in patients with RA than in the general population."
"Cytokines of the interleukin-6 (IL-6) family are important soluble mediators with crucial roles in developmental processes, tissue homeostasis, regeneration, and immune cell differentiation. Overshooting activities of IL-6 and other cytokines are found in all inflammatory diseases, making them attractive therapeutic targets for the treatment of patients with rheumatoid arthritis or inflammatory bowel disease. Multiple mechanisms exist that control cytokine activity and prevent excessive cytokine signaling under normal conditions. In this review, we summarize how the biology of IL-6 family cytokines is regulated by glycosylation, a process in which carbohydrate chains are covalently linked to protein molecules. The attached carbohydrates, which are generated and modified by enzymes located in the endoplasmic reticulum and/or the Golgi apparatus, can display huge structural diversity and are linked either via asparagine (N-glycans), serine and threonine (O-glycans), or tryptophan residues (C-glycans). We describe how glycosylation affects synthesis, receptor binding, signaling and plasma half-life of the cytokines and protein stability, transport to the cell surface, ligand binding, proteolysis, internalization, and recycling of their receptors. Finally, we discuss how knowledge about glycosylation can be used for the design of novel therapeutics targeting IL-6 family cytokines or their receptors."
"IL-1β-expressing macrophages have been described in rheumatoid arthritis (RA), immune checkpoint inhibitor-induced inflammatory arthritis (ICI-arthritis), and pancreatic cancer and proposed to be pathogenic. IL-1β+ macrophages express genes cooperatively induced by PGE2 and TNF signaling, but mechanisms that induce these cells are not known. We used an integrated transcriptomic and epigenomic analysis in primary human monocytes to study PGE2-TNF crosstalk, and how it is regulated by IFN-γ, as occurs in RA synovial macrophages. We identified a TNF + PGE2 (TP) induced gene expression signature that is enriched in IL1β+ RA and ICI-arthritis monocytic subsets, and includes genes in pathogenic IL-1, Notch and neutrophil chemokine pathways. ICI-arthritis myeloid cells mapped primarily onto four previously defined RA synovial monocytic clusters, and TP genes were expressed in a manner suggestive of a new functional monocyte subset. TP signature genes are distinct from canonical inflammatory NF-κB target genes such as <i>TNF</i>, <i>IL6</i> and <i>IL12B</i> and are activated by cooperation of PGE2-induced AP-1, CEBP and NR4A family transcription factors with TNF-induced NF-κB activity. Unexpectedly, IFN-γ suppressed induction of AP-1, CEBP and NR4A activity to ablate induction of IL-1, Notch and neutrophil chemokine genes, while promoting expression of distinct inflammatory genes such as <i>TNF</i> and T cell chemokines like CXCL10. The opposing cross-regulation of PGE2 and IFN signaling in vitro was reflected in vivo in mutually exclusive expression of TP and IFN signatures in different cell clusters in RA and ICI-arthritis monocytes. These results reveal the basis for synergistic induction of inflammatory genes by PGE2 and TNF, and a novel regulatory axis whereby IFN-γ and PGE2 oppose each other to determine the balance between two distinct TNF-induced inflammatory gene expression programs relevant for RA and ICI-arthritis."
"This systematic review evaluates the impact of immune-mediated inflammatory diseases (IMIDs) on sexual function and health-related quality of life (HR-QoL) in both men and women, from a biopsychosocial perspective. Diseases assessed include rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, psoriasis, ankylosing spondylitis, Crohn's disease, and ulcerative colitis. A total of 42 studies were included following a systematic search in PubMed/MEDLINE. The review adhered to PRISMA guidelines and was registered in PROSPERO (CRD42024518043). Results highlight a high prevalence of sexual dysfunction in IMID patients, significantly impairing quality of life. Assessments were primarily conducted using the Female Sexual Function Index (FSFI) and the International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF). Women, particularly those with rheumatoid arthritis and inflammatory bowel disease, exhibited higher vulnerability, with risk factors being disease severity, pain, depression, and anxiety. These findings underscore the necessity of a multidisciplinary and biopsychosocial approach involving rheumatologists, gastroenterologists, psychologists, and sexologists. Regular assessments and tailored interventions targeting sexual health are essential to optimize outcomes and to address this often overlooked dimension of patient care."
"To develop a prognostic nomogram integrating clinical, inflammatory, and immune parameters for rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients receiving Yunke-drug combination therapy, facilitating personalized treatment decisions. We retrospectively analyzed 304 RA patients (2010-2024) divided into training (<i>n</i> = 213) and validation (<i>n</i> = 91) cohorts. Predictor selection through univariate/multivariate logistic regression informed nomogram construction. Model performance was assessed via ROC curves, calibration plots, and decision curve analysis (DCA). Six independent predictors emerged: elevated rheumatoid factor (OR = 1.32, 1.08-1.62), CRP > 10 mg/L (OR = 2.14, 1.45-3.16), ≥4 swollen joints (OR = 1.87, 1.22-2.88), TNF-<i>α</i> > 8.1 pg./mL (OR = 2.05, 1.33-3.17), IL-6 > 15 pg./mL (OR = 1.94, 1.25-3.01), and CD3 + T cells <650/μL (OR = 1.76, 1.15-2.70) (all <i>p</i> < 0.05). The nomogram showed strong discrimination (C-index: 0.883 training; 0.823 validation) with AUCs of 0.881 (0.804-0.958) and 0.823 (0.679-0.966). Sensitivity/specificity reached 94.3%/90.7% (training) versus 78.3%/81.2% (validation). DCA confirmed clinical utility across probability thresholds (15-85%). This first multifactorial nomogram for Yunke-combined therapy integrates joint assessments, serum biomarkers, cytokine profiles, and cellular immunity indicators. Demonstrated predictive accuracy (30.5% training; 29.7% validation response rates) supports its potential for therapeutic monitoring. While internally validated, multicenter studies are required to confirm generalizability. The model establishes a framework for precision RA management, with implications for dose optimization and resistance mechanism research."
"Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic inflammatory autoimmune disease with the primary clinical symptoms of joint swelling and pain. Among the currently available therapeutic agents, methotrexate (MTX) is an internationally recognized first-line disease-modifying antirheumatic drug (DMARD) for RA and is widely used as a basic drug in combination therapies. The Bushen Jiedu Tongluo Decoction (BSJDTL), an herbal formula, has been used for the treatment of RA for more than ten years with a better curative effect. Therefore, we designed a multi-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study, to scientifically evaluate the clinical efficacy and safety of BSJDTL for active RA. This was a multi-center, randomized, double-blind placebo-controlled trial. A total of 120 adult participants with active RA will be enrolled, with a balanced treatment allocation (1:1). The treatment intervention will be BSJDTL plus the conventional medicine methotrexate, and the control intervention will be placebo plus the conventional drug methotrexate for 24 weeks. In addition, both groups received folic acid during treatment to prevent side effects of methotrexate. The primary outcome was DAS28-ESR. Secondary outcomes included changes in joint symptoms and signs, ESR, CRP, MIF, MMP2, CD147, ICAM-1, VCAM-1, and HIF-1α levels, and joint evaluation via musculoskeletal ultrasound and X-ray. We designed this multi-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial, utilizing assessment of RA activity and imaging techniques (musculoskeletal ultrasound and X-ray) to scientifically evaluate the clinical efficacy and safety of BSJDTL for active RA. The results of this trial may provide insights into improving the clinical symptoms of patients with RA. We hope that this trial will provide preliminary evidence of the efficacy of BSJDTL in treating RA patients and that these results will aid researchers, practitioners, and patients alike. This study aimed to clarify the efficacy and safety of BSJDTL in patients with active RA. International Traditional Medicine Clinical Trial Registry, ITMCTR2025000194."
"Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a multifactorial autoimmune disease primarily affecting the joints. This study, grounded on bioinformatics insights, investigates the biological effects of zinc finger E-box binding homeobox 1 (ZEB1) in the context of RA and delves into the functional mechanism. A murine model of RA was induced by collagen type II challenge. ZEB1 expression in the bone tissue of RA mice was determined by immunohistochemistry or RT-qPCR. Transcriptional targets of ZEB1 were predicted using bioinformatics. Gain-of-function assays of ZEB1 and amphiregulin (AREG) were performed to analyze their roles in arthritis severity, bone loss, inflammation, and macrophage polarization in mice. Furthermore, the pro-inflammatory activation and osteoclastic differentiation of mouse RAW264.7 macrophages upon ZEB1 and AREG overexpression were determined for in vitro verification. ZEB1 was poorly expressed in the modeled mice. Its upregulation alleviated arthritis severity, reduced serum levels of inflammatory cytokines, alleviated bone erosion and cartilage loss, and reduced M1 polarization of macrophages in mice. In vitro, ZEB1 upregulation reduced pro-inflammatory activation and osteoclastic differentiation of mouse RAW264.7 macrophages after specific stimuli. AREG was identified as a transcriptional target of ZEB1, highly expressed in RA. The additional overexpression of AREG counteracted the RA-ameliorating effect of ZEB1 in mice and restored inflammatory activation and osteoclastogenesis of RAW264.7 cells in vitro. This study demonstrates that ZEB1 represses AREG transcription, thus alleviating pro-inflammatory activation and osteoclastic differentiation of macrophages in the context of RA."
"Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is an autoimmune disease that features chronic inflammation of the joints, destruction of the synovial tissue, and progressive disability. Traditional treatments with disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs), nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), and glucocorticoids are usually linked to systemic side effects and low therapeutic effi-cacy. Drug delivery systems based on nanotechnology have been presented as a valuable strategy for the improvement of drug bioavailability, toxicity decrease, and targeted treatment of RA. This review discusses the latest developments in nanotechnology-based drug delivery systems, such as liposomes, niosomes, nanoemulsions, solid lipid nanoparticles, ethosomes, and transferosomes, focusing specif-ically on transdermal drug delivery systems (TDDS). These nanocarriers provide long-term release of the drug, enhanced permeability, and enhanced therapeutic activity by more targeted delivery to inflamed areas. In addition, the combination of combination therapy, co-delivery approaches, and phototherapy has also exhibited synergistic effects to evade drug resistance and improve anti-inflam-matory activity. Despite these developments, formulation stability, industrial manufacturing, and clinical translation remain critical challenges. Additional studies and clinical evidence are required to maximize nanotechnology-based therapies and integrate them into RA therapy."
"Autoimmune diseases (AID) have been showed to be susceptibility to malignancy. This study aimed to analyzed the profile of serum tumor markers in four common autoimmune disease. Patients with dermatomyositis (DM, n = 132), Systemic sclerosis (SSc, n = 77), Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE, n = 191), Rheumatoid arthritis (RA, n = 160) and ovarian cancer (n = 250) were included in this study. Twelve tumor markers (CA724, AFP, FRT, NSE, CA19-9, CA125, CYFRA21-1, CA153, β-HCG and HE4) levels and abnormal rate in these patients were retrospective statistics. The tumor markers profiles were compared among the different AID. Compared with ovarian cancer (OV) patients, there were no significant differences for the levels and abnormal rates of CYFRA21-1/HE4/CA50/FRT in AID patients. The levels and abnormal rates of CA724/FRT/CA125/NSE were higher in OV patients than that in AID patients. 75% AID patients have at least one elevated tumor marker. 69.46% AID patients have 2-5 elevated tumor markers. All the 12 tumor markers were negative in 16.67, 19.74, 27.23 and 32.70% of DM, SSc, SLE and RA patients. Except CA50, the levels of the other eleven tumor markers were significantly different between DM/SSc/SLE/RA. Except AFP/β-HCG/SCC, the abnormal rate of the other tumor markers were significantly different between these AID. The increased levels of tumor makers were common in four major AID, and the profile of tumor makers were significantly different among these AID."
"Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic autoimmune disease characterized by cartilage damage and bone erosion. Current pharmacological treatments often fail to repair damaged tissues and may cause severe immune-related side effects. Moreover, some patients exhibit inadequate responses to existing therapies. This study evaluated the therapeutic potential of extracellular vesicles (EV) derived from immortalized mesenchymal stem cells (iMSCs) overexpressing cytotoxic T lymphocyte-associated antigen-4 immunoglobulin fusion protein (CTLA4Ig) (CT-EV) compared with iMSC-derived EVs (ASC-EV). Following EV characterization and in vitro functional assessments, collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) model mice (n = 10/group) were treated with Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline (dPBS, 150 µL, twice weekly; Group C), ASC-EV (derived from the culture supernatant of 2 × 10<sup>6</sup> iMSCs/150 µL of dPBS, twice weekly; Group E), CT-EV (derived from the culture supernatant of 2 × 10<sup>6</sup> CTLA4Ig-overexpressing iMSCs/150 µL of dPBS, twice weekly; Group CT), or methotrexate (3 mg/kg, three times per week; Group M). A normal control group received dPBS (150 µL, twice weekly; Group N). CT-EV showed a significant increase in EV quantity and the production of CTLA4, transforming growth factor β1, and interleukin (IL)-1 receptor antagonist compared with ASC-EV. In mitogen-stimulated immune cells from CIA mice, CT-EV significantly reduced IL-6, IL-10, and Regulated upon Activation, Normal T cell Expressed and Presumably Secreted (RANTES) levels. Administration of both ASC-EV and CT-EV led to a decrease in macrophage proportions and an increase in T helper type 2 cells and serum IL-4 levels. Furthermore, CT-EV treatment resulted in additional reductions in anti-CII antibody levels, C-telopeptide II concentrations, and the proportion of CD138⁺ cells, thereby contributing to cartilage protection. CT-EV demonstrated superior therapeutic effects compared with ASC-EV in the CIA model, highlighting its potential as an effective treatment strategy for RA."
"The imbalance of macrophage polarization plays a pivotal role in the progression of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Reprogramming macrophages from the pro-inflammatory M1 phenotype to the anti-inflammatory M2 phenotype is considered a promising therapeutic strategy. To address this challenge, Panax notoginseng polysaccharides (PNP) with varying molecular weights were chemically conjugated with deoxycholic acid (DC) to obtain amphiphilic conjugates (PNP-DC), which self-assembled into micelles (PNP-Ms). After screening for optimal molecular weight, folic acid (FA) was introduced onto the micelle surface, and Polyphyllin I (PPI) was encapsulated to form FA-modified, PPI-loaded micelles (FA-PPI-Ms) with macrophage-targeting capability. FA-PPI-Ms showed enhanced cellular uptake via FA receptor-mediated endocytosis and effectively eliminated reactive oxygen species (ROS), reduced inflammatory cytokine production, and exhibited good biosafety. In vivo, FA-PPI-Ms significantly alleviated joint swelling and inflammation in RA rat models. Mechanistic studies based on RNA sequencing and experimental validation revealed that FA-PPI-Ms suppressed the JAK2/STAT3 signaling pathway, thereby promoting M2 macrophage polarization and restoring the M1/M2 balance. This study presents a novel FA-PPI-Ms delivery system for targeted macrophages. By modulating polarization through inhibition of JAK2/STAT3 signaling, the system offers a promising therapeutic strategy for RA and potentially other inflammatory diseases."
"The burden of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is profound, although treated with the treat-to-target strategy for RA patients according to the two most influential organisations for rheumatology worldwide. The need to timely achieve the control of disease activity for RA patients, especially for those difficult-to-treat individuals, is still unmet. Besides, the data on the diagnosis and prognosis of RA-related complications or comorbidities such as sarcopenia, cardiovascular diseases (CVD), malignancies and infections in large real-world cohorts are still limited. Therefore, the aim of this large-scale cohort study is to identify the development of clinical, biomedical, histopathological and imaging biomarkers for the diagnosis and prognosis of difficult-to-treat RA, and RA-related complications/comorbidities and to evaluate their impact on the prognosis of RA. In this real-world multicentre prospective cohort, consecutive RA patients are planned to be recruited during 2024 and 2033 and with at least 5-year follow-up. Sociodemographic characteristics collection, clinical assessment, muscle assessment, histopathological assessment, imaging examination and biological samples collection will be performed at baseline, 1st, 3rd, 6th and 12th month during the first year and subsequently every 6 months until 5 years to repeat the assessments and collect the information of interested outcomes. The outcomes of interest include RA disease outcomes (including disease activity, functional and radiographic indicators) and RA-related complications/comorbidities (eg, sarcopenia, CVD, malignancies and specific infection). Ethical approval has been approved by the Medical Ethics Committee of Sun Yat-sen Memorial Hospital, Sun Yat-sen University (ID: SYSKY-2023-1235-01); the Affiliated Panyu Central Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University (ID: PYRC-2024-214-01); and ShenShan Medical center, Memorial Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University (ID: 2024-SSKY-118-01). All study participants sign an informed consent form. Dissemination of results will occur via national and international conferences, in peer-reviewed journals, public conferences and social media.

"Sjögren's disease (SjD), or Sjögren's syndrome, is a chronic autoimmune condition that targets exocrine glands, leading to dryness symptoms. With the treatment plan for SjD having remained unchanged for the past decade, there is a critical need for innovative therapeutic strategies. To bridge the gap between mouse models and human patients, we have established a mouse model of experimental Sjögren's syndrome with a human immune system (HIS-ESS). Immunizing mice with antigens derived from human salivary epithelial cells results in HIS-ESS mice that display clinical features of SjD that include salivary dysfunction, increased serum autoantibodies, and dysregulated immune responses. Effector T cell subsets such as Th1, Th17, and T follicular helper (Tfh) cells are also elevated in HIS-ESS mice. Thus, this humanized model can effectively recapitulate SjD outcomes and immunopathogenesis, offering a promising platform for drug screening and preclinical research. © 2025 Wiley Periodicals LLC.

"<b>Background:</b> Osteoblasts, derived from mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) in the bone marrow, are responsible for bone formation. Osteoblast differentiation is orchestrated by a spectrum of biological signals, with immune-derived components serving as indispensable regulators in this network. Dysfunctional osteoblast differentiation underlies bone-related pathologies such as osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, and osteoporosis, where immune dysregulation drives inflammatory cascades that disrupt the osteoblast-osteoclast equilibrium. This bidirectional crosstalk has propelled the emergence of osteoimmunology as a pivotal discipline.<b>Methods:</b> By analyzing immune cells and cytokines in the immune microenvironment, we synthesize evidence on their roles in regulating osteoblast differentiation, with focus on inflammatory bone disorders, particularly in osteoarthritis.<b>Results:</b> Thus, bone growth, development, and healing are intrinsically coupled with the dynamics of the immune microenvironment, which contributes to subchondral bone sclerosis and disease progression in osteoarthritis. Therefore, targeting immune-osteoblast crosstalk offers therapeutic potential for bone pathologies.<b>Conclusion:</b> This review consolidates recent advances in understanding how the immune microenvironment impacts osteoblast differentiation, aiming to provide novel insights for clinical strategies targeting bone repair and disease mitigation."
"Motivation and adherence are crucial for effective rehabilitation, yet engagement remains a challenge in upper limb physiotherapy. Serious Games (SGs) have emerged as a promising tool to enhance patient motivation. This study evaluates Painting Discovery, a projected augmented reality (AR) SG for shoulder rehabilitation, assessing engagement, ergonomics, and its potential to differentiate motor performance between healthy and those with rheumatoid arthritis, bursitis, subacromial impingement, rotator cuff tear, or calcific tendinopathy. Additionally, it examines improvements in pathological subjects following physiotherapy. Sixteen healthy and seven pathological subjects participated. Engagement, ergonomics, and satisfaction were assessed using Likert-scale questionnaires. Motor performance was evaluated through completion time, speed, acceleration, and normalized jerk. Four pathological subjects underwent pre- and post-physiotherapy assessments over six weeks. SG was highly engaging and ergonomic, with no significant differences based on prior video game or AR experience. The pathological group had longer completion times ([Formula: see text]s vs. [Formula: see text]s, p < 0.001), lower acceleration ([Formula: see text] m/s2 vs. [Formula: see text] m/s2, p < 0.001), and higher jerk ([Formula: see text] m/s3 vs. [Formula: see text] m/s3, p = 0.025) then healthy subjects. After physiotherapy, completion time and normalized jerk indicated enhanced efficiency and control. Painting Discovery shows strong potential as an engaging, accessible rehabilitation tool. While effective in differentiating motor impairments, its small sample size and horizontal-plane movement focus limit broader conclusions. Future studies should expand participation, incorporate vertical-plane movements, and refine performance metrics for clinical validation."
"Methotrexate is a widely used medication in dermatology, rheumatology, and oncology. However, patient misunderstandings or attempts to expedite symptom relief can lead to overuse, resulting in severe toxicity. This case series presents five instances of methotrexate toxicity due to daily dosing and excessive use for underlying disorders. All patients exhibited fever, skin, and mucosal lesions, alongside abnormal hematological parameters. Management involved immediate cessation of methotrexate, administration of leucovorin rescue therapy, and supportive care. Three patients fully recovered with the resolution of lesions and improved hematological profiles, while two succumbed to the illness. These cases underscore the critical need for early recognition of methotrexate toxicity symptoms and comprehensive patient counseling on proper dosing schedules to prevent such adverse outcomes."
"Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic autoimmune disease characterized by persistent inflammation. Vitamin D deficiency and elevated levels of IL-8 have been implicated in the pathogenesis of RA. This cross-sectional study aims to compare Vitamin D and IL-8 levels between RA patients and healthy controls and assess the relationship between Vitamin D, IL-8, and other inflammatory markers in RA patients. The study included 123 participants divided into two groups: 63 RA patients and 60 healthy controls, with equal numbers of males and females in each group. Serum levels of Vitamin D, IL-8, rheumatoid factor (RF), anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide (anti-CCP) antibodies, C-reactive protein (CRP), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), and white blood cell (WBC) count were measured and compared between the groups. RA patients had a higher percentage of females (74.6%) compared to the control group (41.7%). Vitamin D levels were significantly lower in RA patients compared to controls (41.4 ± 25.2 vs 46.5 ± 12.4, p = 0.002). IL-8 levels were significantly higher in the RA group compared to controls (546.9 pg/mL vs 3.1 pg/mL, p < 0.001). RF and anti-CCP antibody levels were also significantly higher in RA patients. However, no significant correlation was found between IL-8, Vitamin D, and other inflammatory markers. The findings highlight the importance of Vitamin D screening or intervention in RA patients due to its potential impact on immune function and disease progression. The elevated IL-8 levels and other inflammatory markers confirm the chronic inflammatory state in RA, emphasizing the need for continuous inflammation-targeted approaches, including pharmacological treatment and lifestyle modifications."
"This study aimed to identify potential diagnostic biomarkers for systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) using metabolomics approaches and machine learning algorithms, and to evaluate therapeutic targets for SLE treatment. Serum samples from 44 SLE patients with lupus nephritis, 40 rheumatoid arthritis patients, 39 primary Sjögren's syndrome patients, and matched healthy controls were analyzed using ultra-performance liquid chromatography-high resolution mass spectrometry (UPLC-HRMS). Eight machine learning algorithms were employed to establish diagnostic models. Partial least squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) and orthogonal PLS-DA (OPLS-DA) were used to identify differential metabolites. The therapeutic potential of identified metabolites was validated in MRL-Fas <i><sup>lpr</sup></i> mice through histological examination, flow cytometry, and biochemical analysis. A total of 129 metabolites were detected, with machine learning models achieving area under the curve (AUC) values >0.8. The principal component regression model performed best with AUC values of 0.99 and 0.96 for training and test datasets, respectively. Two key metabolites, tryptophan and beta-alanine, showed significantly decreased levels in SLE patients compared to healthy controls (both p<0.05), while exhibiting opposite patterns in other autoimmune diseases. In the mouse model, tryptophan supplementation improved renal histology, reduced proteinuria, increased naïve T cells and central memory T cells, and decreased effector T cell frequencies in both peripheral blood and spleen. This study demonstrates the successful application of machine learning algorithms to metabolomics data for SLE classification and identifies tryptophan and beta-alanine as potential SLE-specific biomarkers. Tryptophan supplementation shows therapeutic promise in lupus mouse models through immunomodulatory effects on T cell subsets and renal protection."
"Autoimmune diseases are a set of conditions in which the immune system incorrectly identifies and attacks the body's own healthy tissue, severely compromising patient health. While current treatments can somewhat control disease progression, their long-term effectiveness remains limited, necessitating the development of more effective therapeutic approaches. Lactate and lactylation are critical links between metabolic reprogramming and epigenetics. As an emerging epigenetic modification, lactylation induced by lactate is closely associated with the onset of autoimmune diseases. Lactylation can be categorized into histone and nonhistone modifications, both of which play pivotal roles in cellular functions and pathophysiological processes through distinct regulatory mechanisms. Lactylation impacts immune cell function by regulating metabolic reprogramming and signaling pathways. In autoimmune diseases, immune cell metabolic reprogramming controls lactylation levels through metabolic byproducts, and lactylation, in turn, modulates the cellular metabolism by altering the transcription and structure of key enzymes. These interconnected processes collectively drive disease progression. To better understand the role of lactate and lactylation in the pathogenesis of autoimmune diseases, this review synthesizes the effects on specific immune cells, examining their dual effects on immune system function and their particular impacts on two common autoimmune diseases-rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). By combining the established role of lactate in immune metabolic reprogramming with the emerging understanding of the influence of lactate-induced lactylation on epigenetic regulation, this paper explores the relationship between lactylation and the progression of autoimmune diseases. This approach aims to enhance the understanding of the interplay between epigenetics and metabolism in autoimmune disease development, providing new perspectives for future therapeutic strategies. Studies collectively indicate that treatment can be improved through regulating key enzymes involved in lactylation, targeting lactate production pathways, integrating innovative approaches with current therapies, and adopting personalized treatment strategies."
"Sjogren's syndrome is an autoimmune disease characterized by lymphocytic infiltration of exocrine glands resulting in xerostomia and dry eyes affecting entire body. A 40-year-old woman presented with generalized weakness and shortness of breath. She had reduced muscle power (2/5) with reduced tone, and absent reflexes in four limbs. Further investigation revealed severe hypokalemia with metabolic acidosis. She was treated with intravenous potassium chloride and diagnosed with Sjogren's syndrome based on her serology profile. After treatment, her condition improved. Hypokalemia occurs due to increased renal excretions of potassium. Distal Renal Tubular Acidosis is a major cause of potassium loss in urine. Sjogren's Syndrome is an important cause of Distal Renal Tubular Acidosis, which can present as severe hypokalemia. Although it commonly presents with symptoms like dry eyes and dry mouth, it can rarely present as Distal Renal Tubular Acidosis and hypokalemia as the primary presentation. Sjogren's syndrome should be suspected in patients with hypokalemia with features of Distal Renal Tubular Acidosis."
"Lupus erythematosus is a multisystem disease which frequently involves the skin. There are several variants of cutaneous lupus, which are defined and classified by the location and the depth of the inflammatory infiltrate, adnexal involvement, presence or absence of interphase dermatitis, and chronology (1). The most common clinical subtypes are acute, subacute and chronic cutaneous lupus erythematosus; however, other rare specific and non-specific cutaneous involvements also exist (2). Rowell syndrome is one of these rare specific variants and was originally described as the association of lupus erythematosus, erythema multiforme-like lesions without any known precipitating factors, and immunological abnormalities such as a speckled pattern of antinuclear antibody (ANA) staining, positive Anti-La antibody, and reactive rheumatoid factor (3). Subsequently, in order to enhance diagnostic specificity, the criteria were redefined as major (lupus erythematosus, erythema multiforme-like lesions, speckled pattern of ANA staining) and minor (chilblains, positive Anti-La or Anti-Ro antibodies, reactive rheumatoid factor); patients should present all three major criteria plus at least one minor criterion to be diagnosed with Rowell syndrome (4). First line treatment options for cutaneous lupus as well for Rowell syndrome comprise topical corticosteroids and calcineurin inhibitors, systemic anti-malarial therapy, and systemic corticosteroids (for active disease). In anti-malarial resistant disease, retinoids, dapsone, methotrexate, and other systemic immunosuppressive agents can be considered, though with a lower level of evidence (5). Herein, we present the case of a patient with Rowell syndrome with a therapeutic approach that is rarely included in the literature. Informed consent was obtained and signed from the patient regarding the use of the patient's information for the purposes of writing a case report publication. A 38-year-old woman who had been examined by the Rheumatology Department for connective tissue disease (CTD) because of her morning stiffness and peripheral arthritis was referred to us for consultation due to the new onset of a mild, itchy rash. The patient's lesions first appeared on her face, neck and upper trunk, subsequently becoming generalized. There was no previous history of recent infection or medication. The patient underwent follow-up under hydroxychloroquine therapy (400 mg/day) for CTD for 2 months. Dermatological physical examination showed violaceous-dark erythematous plaques with a prominent arcuate/targetoid shape at the periphery were present on her whole body, with oral mucosal erosions (Figure 1). In previous laboratory studies, ANA positivity with a speckled pattern and Anti-Ro positivity were observed. Rheumatoid factor was non-reactive. A punch biopsy was performed. Histopathological examination showed prominent interface dermatitis with basal vacuolar degeneration and apoptotic keratinocytes, which corresponds to subacute cutaneous lupus erythematosus. Due to the presence of three major criteria and one minor criterion, the patient was diagnosed with Rowell syndrome. She was given additional treatment comprising 1 mg/kg/day oral methylprednisolone. However cutaneous involvement progressed rapidly, and the methylprednisolone dose was increased to 500 mg/day intravenously for three consecutive days as pulse steroid therapy. Thereafter, upon clinical irresponsiveness, oral cyclosporine was started at 3.5 mg/kg/day, and systemic corticosteroid therapy was gradually ceased. An excellent and complete clinical response was achieved at the fourth week of the cyclosporine treatment (Figure 2). Cyclosporine is a rapid-acting immunosuppressive agent which inhibits calcineurin and blocks T-lymphocyte response (5). Just one Rowell syndrome case treated with cyclosporine has been reported so far in the literature (6). Even though cyclosporine therapy is not suggested for cutaneous lupus erythematosus without systemic involvement (4), it can considered as a treatment method due to its rapid and dramatic effectiveness, especially in cases that do not respond to steroids while presenting with rapid progression."
"Familial benign chronic pemphigus, also known as Hailey-Hailey disease, was first described by the Hailey brothers in 1939 (1). It represents a chronic autosomal-dominant genetic skin disorder with incomplete penetrance, usually diagnosed in children and young adults. As a result, family history of this disorder can be elicited in only about 66% of patients. We describe herein a patient with Hailey-Hailey disease who received treatment with hydroxyurea for a new diagnosis of polycythemia vera, with a surprising outcome. A 54-year-old man was diagnosed with Hailey-Hailey disease at age ten when he presented with several erythematous and blistering skin lesions involving the neck, wrist flexure surfaces, and the forearms. The patient underwent regular dermatology follow-up for this condition. His disease followed a relapsing-remitting pattern, with short disease-free intervals. It predominantly involved the neck, torso, and upper extremities (Figure 1), and only rarely buttocks and groin areas. Initially, mild-moderate potency topical steroid creams were tried, with only modest success. Topical antibiotics were required on several occasions due to secondary infections. Photodynamic therapy was only minimally helpful, as the disease continued to worsen. In his 40s, the disease became more difficult to manage, and several systemic options were tried, with very little if any success. Thus, the patient failed oral steroids, dapsone and azathioprine. He became anxious, depressed, and socially isolated. Other past medical history was significant for hypertension. The patient was a never-smoker, and denied alcohol or drug abuse. There was no family history of skin disorders of cancers in his immediate family members. In May 2019, the patient presented with elevated hemoglobin/hematocrit and moderate thrombocytosis. Further work-up identified JAK-2 V617F kinase mutated polycythemia vera, for which he was started on periodic phlebotomies and low-dose aspirin. Four months later, hydroxyurea was prescribed due to increased phlebotomy needs and worsening thrombocytosis. The hydroxyurea dose was subsequently titrated to 1000 mg orally per day, alternating with 1500 mg orally per day. The patient tolerated this agent well, without significant side-effects. He also achieved excellent control of hematocrit and normalization of platelet count. Pleasantly surprised, the patient also realized that he had not experienced any more relapsing Hailey-Hailey skin lesions 8 weeks after the commencement of hydroxyurea. Four years later, his polycythemia remains in excellent control. He also remains without any further evidence of skin lesions. The hallmark of Hailey-Hailey disease is believed to be the haploinsufficiency of the enzyme ATP2C1 (2). The ATP2C1 gene is located on chromosome 3 and encodes a Ca2+ ATPase protein. A mutation in one copy of the gene causes only half of this necessary protein to be synthesized. Consequently, impaired keratinocyte adhesion ensues, leading to acantholysis, blisters, and rash (2). The initial lesion may be an erythematous area or a fluid-filled blister which subsequently ruptures, leading to a macerated or crusted lesion. The lesions more commonly affect the sides of the neck, armpits, forearms, buttocks and groins, but may expand to a generalized skin eruption. Patients may complain of itching in the affected areas, potentially leading to social distress and isolation (3). Affected areas undergo repeated blistering and inflammation, and may be tender to touch. A pattern of multiple relapses and remissions is characteristic of Hailey-Hailey disease. Nonetheless, most lesions are transient and leave little or no scars (Figure 2). The differential diagnosis includes intertrigo, contact dermatitis, pemphigus, psoriasis, and cutaneous candidiasis. Skin biopsy and/or family history can confirm the diagnosis of Hailey-Hayley disease. The lack of both mucosal lesions and intercellular antibodies on immunohistochemistry distinguishes this entity from other forms of pemphigus. Hailey-Hayley disease is currently believed to be incurable, and its complications include secondary bacterial, viral, or fungal infections, which may require antimicrobial agents (4). The patients are advised to avoid friction and sweating by wearing light cotton clothes. Sun avoidance as much as possible and using SPF 50 sunscreen while in the sun are advised. Applying soothing compresses followed by topical corticosteroid cream can offer symptom relief (3,4). Topical antibiotics can be used for localized lesions. Generalized lesions may require systemic steroids and antibiotics. Topical tacrolimus, laser, and photodynamic therapy have been used with varying degrees of success in the second line (4). Oral dapsone, cyclosporine, azathioprine, thalidomide, etretinate, and intramuscular alefacept were shown to control the mild-moderate disease but not severe chronic or relapsing forms (4). Surgical skin grafting usually represents the last resort in resistant localized disease. Mestre et al. (5) described a case of chronic Hailey-Hailey disease in a Caucasian woman, whose skin lesions were refractory to topical and oral steroids, tetracyclines, antifungals, and azathioprine. After introduction of weekly oral methotrexate for rheumatoid arthritis treatment, the skin lesions regressed, with significant impact on the patient's quality of life. Similarly, Hailey-Hailey disease in our patient responded completely to hydroxyurea, without any relapses over a 4-year interval. Hydroxyurea has been used for many decades in hematology and oncology, has a favorable side-effect profile, and is cost-effective. Our case report supports the clinical evidence of hydroxyurea's potential role in Hailey-Hailey disease treatment. There is hope that our findings will be confirmed by larger studies and shift the treatment paradigm in severe chronic or relapsing-remitting forms of Hailey-Hailey disease."
"The inflammatory microenvironment in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) synovium is highly complex, comprising functional units known as cellular neighborhoods (CNs). However, how cell interactions within CNs shape the inflammatory microenvironment in RA remains unclear. Here, we utilized imaging mass cytometry (IMC) and single-cell RNA sequencing to dissect the CNs within RA synovium, uncovering critical cell-cell interactions and evaluating whether disrupting interaction signals could alleviate disease severity in collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) mouse model. Our findings revealed that CNs enriched with fibroblast-like synoviocytes (FLS) and immune cells, particularly FLS and macrophages, were more frequent in RA synovium compared to osteoarthritis (OA). Further single-cell RNA sequencing analysis showed that FLS specifically upregulated complement C3 while macrophages displayed high level of C3 receptor, C3aR1. Interestingly, C3a derived from FLS enhanced type I interferon response in macrophages, and blockade of the C3a-C3aR1 signaling reduced secretion of IFN-β in macrophages, thereby affecting FLS activation. Additionally, inhibition of C3a-C3aR1 signaling attenuated the severity of CIA mice with decreased immune cell infiltration, reduced FLS activation, and less bone destruction. Our study suggests that FLS promotes synovial inflammation via interaction with macrophages through a C3a-C3aR1 signaling-mediated positive feedback regulation. Thus, targeting C3a-C3aR1 signaling might provide a new therapeutic strategy for RA."
"Trillions of microorganisms inhabit the human body, playing crucial roles in the development of the immune system, maintaining balance within the gut's immune system, and overall well-being. When these microbial communities experience imbalance, known as dysbiosis, it can lead to localized inflammatory conditions such as colitis and inflammatory bowel diseases, as well as systemic autoimmune disorders like type 1 diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis, and multiple sclerosis. Gut microbes engage with the immune system through various means, including influencing host microRNAs to regulate gene expression and generating metabolites that interact with cellular receptors such as TLRs and GPCRs. These interactions impact critical immune processes like the differentiation of lymphocytes, the production of interleukins, and the maintenance of gut barrier function. Looking into, how gut microbes contribute to or defend against systemic autoimmune diseases is crucial for developing strategies to manage or prevent these conditions. These approaches may include dietary or lifestyle modifications, microbiome-targeted therapies such as prebiotics or probiotics, the identification of diagnostic biomarkers for predicting disease risk, and monitoring and intervening in shifts in microbial populations during autoimmune flare-ups. Recognizing the microbiome's significance in systemic autoimmune diseases offers promise for transforming these presently challenging-to-treat conditions into more controllable or preventable ones."
"The Kadsura coccinea (Lem.) A. C. Smith is known as ""Heilaohu"" of the Tujia ethnomedicine in China. It demonstrates activities such as antioxidant properties and liver protection, making it suitable for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, as well as liver and gastrointestinal diseases. In recent years, research on K. coccinea has mainly focused on the analysis of chemical composition and screening for activity, however, the research on the mechanisms of liver protection has not yet been addressed. This study aimed to investigate the hepatoprotective mechanisms of Kadsura coccinea roots ethanol extract (KCE) against Acetaminophen (APAP)-induced acute liver injury (ALI). APAP-induced ALI was induced in male C57BL/6J mice through intraperitoneal APAP injection, followed by 5-day oral KCE treatment. Integrative approaches, including network pharmacology, molecular docking untargeted metabolomics, western blot, hematoxylin-eosin staining, and immunohistochemistry, were used to determine KCE's therapeutic effects. Network pharmacology identified 672 differentially expressed genes, with 128 overlapping targets potentially mediating KCE's hepatoprotection. Molecular docking showed that he binding energy of isovaleroylbinankadsurin A with the top 10 proteins are range from -9.6 to -5.0 kcal/mol. Gene ontology and Kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes analyses revealed that KCE alleviates liver injury by modulating hepatic metabolic pathways. Untargeted metabolomics identified 381 upregulated and 960 downregulated metabolites in the model group versus controls. Additionally, the high-dose KCE group exhibited 280 upregulated and 237 downregulated metabolites versus the model group. Pathway enrichment analysis exhibited significant associations with the synthesis and degradation of ketone bodies, phenylalanine-tyrosine and tryptophan biosynthesis, riboflavin metabolism, glycine-serine and threonine metabolism, glyoxylate and dicarboxylate metabolism, ascorbate and aldarate metabolism, glycerophospholipid metabolism, and arachidonic acid metabolism. This indicated that KCE may alleviate liver injury by regulating apoptosis- and oxidative stress-related pathways. In vivo studies confirmed that KCE reduced serum alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase levels, elevated glutathione, ameliorated histopathological damage, suppressed apoptosis and oxidative stress, upregulated Bcl-2/BAX ratio, HO-1, and Nrf2 expression, and downregulated p-Nrf2, Keap1 and Cleaved caspase 3 level. This study determines KCE's efficacy as a hepatoprotective agent by interacting network pharmacology, untargeted metabolomics, and experimental validation, which demonstrates KCE. In terms of further research, KCE attenuates APAP-induced oxidative stress and apoptosis by inhibiting the Nrf2-Keap1 signaling axis, providing evidence for its potential to prevent APAP-induced ALI."
"Protein tyrosine phosphatases (PTPs) receptor type II A (R2A) are negatively regulated through oligomerization upon binding of their extracellular domains to glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) on heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs). Inactivation of receptor PTP sigma (PTPRS) by HSPGs promotes the aggressive behavior of fibroblast-like synoviocytes (FLS) in rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Blocking the binding of its N-terminal, membrane-distal immunoglobulin-like 1 and 2 (Ig1&2) domains to its GAG ligands on the HSPG syndecan-4 promotes PTPRS activity and reverses the pathogenic phenotype of FLS. The potential for therapeutically leveraging other PTPRS ectodomain regions is, however, unknown. We show targeting the membrane-proximal fibronectin type III-like 9 (Fn9) domain offers a novel avenue to activate PTPRS. We mapped PTPRS Fn9 as the binding site of three antibodies (Abs) (13G5, 22H8, 49F2) and characterized their effects on cells. Despite sharing similar epitopes, we found large differences in the ability of these Abs to regulate PTPRS activity. One of these, 13G5, reduced PTPRS-dependent cell migration, PTPRS co-localization with syndecan-4, and PTPRS oligomerization. Single-chain variable fragment Abs of 13G5 and 22H8 were similarly effective at activating cellular PTPRS as 13G5. Replacing the entire 13G5 constant region enhanced its binding and cellular activity, indicating the Ab's potency can be optimized via isotype engineering. Treatment of cells with recombinant Fn9 protein acted as a decoy, disrupting PTPRS colocalization with syndecan-4 and oligomerization and inhibiting FLS migration. Finally, significant disease mitigation in mice using 13G5-derived Abs suggests a viable strategy for the generation of novel drugs for RA therapy."
"Inflammatory skeletal diseases often result in significant pain and deformities of bone and the surrounding joint tissues, which subsequently cause disorders of immune regulation and calcium‑phosphorus metabolism, greatly impacting patients' quality of life. The precision of drug delivery in inflammatory skeletal diseases is usually limited. Traditional therapies for these conditions require high doses, offer limited efficacy, and frequently lead to side effects that compromise healthy tissues, particularly with prolonged use. Addressing these limitations, biomembrane-camouflaged nanoparticles present a precise and innovative therapeutic strategy with enhanced biocompatibility, targeted delivery to diseased tissues, pharmacokinetic properties, and immune evasion capabilities, improving therapeutic efficacy while reducing adverse effects on healthy tissues, thus adding a vital dimension to inflammatory skeletal disease treatment. By integrating multiple therapeutic functions within a single nanoplatform, these nanostructures introduce transformative strategies that enhance traditional treatment approaches. Here, we provide a comprehensive overview of the latest advancements in the biogenesis, preparation, and functional properties of nanoparticles camouflaged by biomembranes - cell membranes, - extracellular vesicles (EVs), and - liposomes and explore their potential when combined with nanotechnology. Further, we detail biomembrane-camouflaged nanoparticles for inflammatory skeletal disease treatment, examining their applications in osteoarthritis (OA), rheumatoid arthritis (RA), osteomyelitis, osteolysis, and periodontitis. It highlights key advances in immunogenicity reduction, targeted drug delivery, and immune modulation for the effective management of inflammatory skeletal diseases."
"Hidradenitis suppurativa (HS) is a common, chronic, and debilitating inflammatory disease that most commonly affects intertriginous skin. Despite its high heritability, the genetic underpinnings of HS remain poorly understood. To identify genetic signals associated with HS, determine genetic relationships with other diseases, and investigate potential molecular genetic mechanisms. We performed a genome-wide association study meta-analysis of six studies, totaling 4,540 cases and over 1 million controls and identified genetic correlations with other common diseases. We integrated the HS data with expression quantitative trait loci from 10 trait-relevant tissues, epigenomic and transcriptomic data from human scalp, differential expression data from HS lesions versus adjacent skin, and mesenchymal Hi-C chromatin looping data. To identify functional noncoding variants, we performed transcriptional reporter assays for signals near KLF5 and SOX9. We identified eleven significant HS signals across seven loci: four corresponded to previously reported associations, four represented novel signals within known loci, and three were signals in newly implicated loci. We identified significant genetic correlation between HS and other inflammatory conditions, particularly inflammatory bowel disease, rheumatoid arthritis, type 2 diabetes, and asthma. We prioritized candidate genes for the 11 signals. The risk allele at KLF5 exhibited 10-fold greater transcriptional activity than the non-risk allele, while risk alleles at SOX9 showed significantly reduced transcriptional activity. Our results provide insights into potential genetic mechanisms underlying HS and suggest potential therapeutic targets for this challenging condition."
"Sjögren's Disease (SjD), Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA), and Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE) are autoimmune diseases with overlapping genetic features, yet the etiologies of these diseases are poorly understood. Using these rheumatic diseases as an example of proof of concept, our aim was to develop a tool that simplifies analysis of gene-disease associations applicable to any disease and to perform comparisons. This tool is meant to provide insights into associated gene symbols and gene expression data to identify candidate biomarkers in common among these diseases. The Diseasesv2.0 and GTExv8 databases were utilized for data collection, providing searchable disease names, affiliated gene symbols, confidence scores (ranging from 0 to 5, with 5 being the most confident), and gene expression across the panel of 54 tissue types present in GTExv8. Data infrastructure was established on a Postgres database using Plotlyv5.17.0 and Streamlitv1.27.2 Python packages. The resulting database was used to investigate the genetic associations among SjD, RA, and SLE, including confidence scores from 2.50 to 5.00. STRINGv12 analysis determined significant pathways (FDR < 0.05). Analysis using our tool revealed the following refined gene associations for each disease: SjD based on 'Sjogren' search term (<i>n</i> = 12 genes), RA (<i>n</i> = 231 genes), and SLE (<i>n</i> = 137 genes). We found seven genes in common, namely, <i>CD4</i>, <i>CD8A</i>, <i>IL6</i>, <i>IL17A</i>, <i>TNFS13B</i>, <i>TNF</i>, and <i>TRIM21</i>. With the exception of IL17A, these genes were expressed in tissue types known or suggested to be affected by SjD. STRINGv12 determined significant KEGG pathways involving interleukin signaling, cytokine signaling, and the immune system. We developed a tool that simplifies the data mining process, allowing users to search for diseases of interest and view common gene associations and gene expression. Some of the genes identified through our tool may be further explored to better understand SjD pathogenesis and systemic impact."
"Lymphotoxin-alpha (LTα3) is a soluble cytokine of the TNF superfamily. Its role in inflammation and arthritis is not well known. Macrophages are important in K/BxN Serum-Transfer Arthritis (STA) and rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Anti-TNF monoclonal antibodies as well as etanercept (ETA), a soluble TNF receptor II that also neutralizes LTα3, are efficient in the treatment of RA. To evaluate the role of LTα3 in macrophage phenotypes and in arthritis. Macrophages were cultured in the presence of recombinant LTα3, and their phenotypes were studied. The clinical effect of blocking LTα3 in STA was evaluated, as well as the effect of switching from anti-TNF monoclonal antibodies to etanercept in the ""ROC"" register of RA patients. We showed that recombinant LTα3 was capable of directing mouse and human macrophages towards a pro-inflammatory ""M1"" phenotype. In K/BxN STA, ETA decreased clinical score and joint swelling. Anti-LTα3 reduced arthritis only in TNF-KO mice, indicating that the effect of LTα3 was visible in the absence of TNF. The ""ROC"" register indicated that switching anti-TNF mAb to ETA did not induce clinical and biological improvement in RA. We show a pro-inflammatory role for LTα3 in murine and human macrophages. The neutralization of both TNF and LTα3 is not beneficial in the treatment of RA."
"Primary Sjögren's syndrome (pSS) exhibits considerable clinical and immunological heterogeneity, complicating personalized management. We aimed to delineate the demographic, functional, serological, histopathological, and therapeutic features of a Romanian pSS cohort and to identify biomarker-treatment correlations that could inform patient-oriented strategies. Thirty-two patients meeting the 2016 ACR/EULAR classification criteria for pSS were retrospectively analyzed. Data collected included demographics, autoantibody profiles (Anti-Ro/SSA, Anti-La/SSB, ANA, RF, Anti-CCP), immunoglobulin levels, complement consumption (C3/C4), minor salivary gland biopsy (focus score), salivary flow tests, and systemic inflammation markers (CRP). Pearson correlation matrices were constructed to explore the associations between serological markers and prescribed therapies. The cohort was predominantly female (87.5%) with a mean age of 52.8 ± 9.9 years. Seropositivity rates were 50% for Anti-Ro/SSA, 77% for Anti-La/SSB, and 40% for ANA. Clinically significant glandular dysfunction was evident in 65% of patients (unstimulated flow ≤ 0.1 mL/min), and all biopsies demonstrated focus scores > 1. Methotrexate use correlated strongly with Anti-Ro/SSA and Anti-La/SSB positivity (<i>p</i> ≤ 0.05), indicating its targeted application in seropositive sub-phenotypes. Conclusion: These findings underscore the immunologic and clinical diversity of pSS and support a biomarker-driven, multidisciplinary framework for personalized treatment. Larger prospective and multicenter studies are warranted to validate these correlations and to refine precision medicine approaches in pSS."
"Dendritic cells (DCs) play a central role in the immunopathogenesis of rheumatoid arthritis (RA), yet their regulation by tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF) and associated receptors remains poorly characterized. We applied a single-cell multi-omics approach (CITE-seq) to profile peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from RA patients and healthy donors, before and after in vitro TNF stimulation. Using integrated analysis of surface protein expression and transcriptomic data, we focused on phenotypic and transcriptional changes in dendritic cell populations. DCs from RA patients exhibited elevated surface expression of CD14 and CD16, indicative of an inflammatory phenotype, and showed marked responsiveness to TNF. Upon stimulation, RA-derived DCs upregulated genes involved in antigen presentation (<i>CD83</i>, <i>LAMP3</i>), lymph node migration (<i>CCR7</i>, <i>ADAM19</i>), and inflammation (<i>TRAF1</i>, <i>IL24</i>) whereas such activation was absent in healthy controls. Our data reveal a TNF-responsive, pro-inflammatory transcriptional program in dendritic cells from RA patients and underscore the relevance of the TNF receptor profile in shaping DC function. These findings provide new insights into the immunobiology of RA and identify dendritic cells as potential targets for personalized immunomodulatory therapy."
"<b>Objectives:</b> We wished to evaluate the safety profile of the Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitors used in the Spanish population; to study the onset of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACEs) and thrombotic events (arterial and venous); and to analyze the factors associated with the onset of these events. <b>Methods:</b> We conducted a retrospective observational study of a cohort of patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA), spondyloarthritis (SpA), and psoriatic arthritis (PsA) included in the biological therapy registry of the Rheumatology Department of Virgen Macarena University Hospital (HUVM), Seville, Spain, who started targeted treatment between 2019 and late 2024. We collected data on disease activity, traditional cardiovascular risk factors, the Charlson comorbidity index, previous synthetic or biologic drug therapy, the use of corticosteroids (and their dose), severity data (structural damage, extra-articular manifestations), and adverse events at the end of follow-up (e.g., MACEs, infections, neoplasms, and herpes zoster). We performed a descriptive bivariate analysis and a multivariate logistic regression analysis (dependent variable: MACEs) to identify factors that were independently associated with MACEs. <b>Results:</b> The study population comprised 137 patients (110 with RA, 18 with PsA, and 9 with SpA) who were followed up for a mean of 3.9 (2.6) years. Most patients had received JAK inhibitors as their second-line or subsequent treatment. At the end of the follow-up, 82 patients (66.7%) continued their treatment. Nine patients (6.6%) experienced a MACE, and five experienced a heart attack. All of these patients had RA. We found no differences between JAK inhibitors in terms of the incidence of the adverse events studied. Patients who experienced MACEs were more often male and smokers (current or former) and more often had hypertension and diabetes. No significant differences were found in the association with disease activity or previous or concomitant treatment. The factors that were independently associated with MACEs were a previous cardiovascular event (OR, 10.74; 95%CI, 1.05-113.7; <i>p</i> = 0.036), male sex (OR, 9.7; 95%CI, 1.6-76.5; <i>p</i> = 0.016), diabetes mellitus (OR, 10.3; 95%CI, 1.75-83; <i>p</i> = 0.013), and the duration of treatment with JAK inhibitors (OR, 1.47; 95%CI, 1.13-2.01; <i>p</i> = 0.005). <b>Conclusions:</b> We found no differences in the onset of adverse events, specifically MACEs, between the different JAK inhibitors analyzed. These events are more common in patients who already have cardiovascular risk factors, such as diabetes mellitus, or who have already experienced a cardiovascular event. JAK inhibitors broadly suppress cytokines in patients whose disease is refractory to other treatments. However, we must continue to evaluate their long-term safety in real-world studies."
"<b>Background:</b> The management of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) has advanced significantly with the introduction of biologic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (bDMARDs). Despite these therapeutic strides, RA prognosis remains profoundly affected by comorbid conditions, particularly cardiovascular and metabolic complications, which increase both morbidity and mortality. The role of bDMARDs in modulating comorbidities remains underexplored, with limited evidence on their effects across various non-RA conditions, such as respiratory, diabetic, and hematologic disorders. This systematic review aimed to evaluate the impact of bDMARDs on the progression and outcomes of comorbidities in RA patients, providing insights to guide personalized treatment approaches. <b>Methods:</b> This systematic review was registered in PROSPERO (CRD42022345903) and followed the PRISMA guidelines. Original research articles from PubMed and Scopus, published up to 18 July 2024, were included. Studies assessing the impact of bDMARDs on comorbidities in RA patients met the eligibility criteria. <b>Results:</b> A total of thirteen studies met the inclusion criteria. They were published from inception until July 2024. The studied comorbidities included pulmonary conditions (asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and interstitial lung disease) (n = 2); diabetes (n = 3); anemia (n = 3); and malignancies (n = 3). The bDMARDs studied were tumor necrosis factor inhibitors (TNFis) (n = 9); Rituximab (n = 5); Tocilizumab (n = 5); Abatacept (n = 5); and Anakinra (n = 2). The most reported effects of bDMARDs on comorbidities were the following: (i) an exacerbation of pulmonary comorbidities for Abatacept and TNFis; (ii) patients switched to or initiated on Abatacept as their first targeted disease-modifying antirheumatic drug (tDMARD) showed directionally lower rates and costs of T2DM-related complications compared with patients switching to or initiating other tDMARDs; (iii) there was no difference between Abatacept and TNFis or Rituximab/Tocilizumab regarding diabetes treatment switching or intensification; (iv) Anakinra significantly reduced the HbA1c%; (v) decreased serum hepcidin levels and improvement in anemia were observed in patients treated with TNFis or Tocilizumab; and (vi) no decrease in overall survival time or the significant incident malignancy rate was noted in RA patients. <b>Conclusions:</b> Overall, bDMARDs appear safe for use in RA patients with comorbidities and may even provide specific benefits for conditions such as anemia and diabetes. These findings suggest that clinicians could consider tailoring biologic therapy based on each patient's comorbidity profile, potentially enhancing both RA management and comorbidity outcomes. For instance, selecting biologics such as Anakinra or Tocilizumab might be advantageous for RA patients with concurrent diabetes or anemia, given their observed metabolic and hematologic benefits. This personalized approach could improve the quality of life and reduce healthcare costs by addressing RA and associated comorbidities more effectively."
"<b>Background/Objectives:</b> Recombinant Fc proteins have been produced that have a protective effect in mouse models of arthritis, such as the K/BxN rheumatoid arthritis model. We have previously shown that a recombinant human IgG1 Fc with a point mutation at position 309, replacing a leucine with a cysteine, fused to the human IgM tailpiece to form a human IgG1 Fc hexamer, rFc-µTP-L309C, effectively prevents neutrophil infiltration into the joints and ameliorates arthritis in the K/BxN serum transfer model and in the endogenous chronic arthritis K/BxN model. We have now investigated the effect of rFc-µTP-L309C on T-cells in the K/BxN chronic arthritis mouse model. <b>Methods:</b> PBMCs were isolated from the spleen, lymph nodes and joint synovial fluid from K/BxN mice having severe chronic arthritis that had been treated with 200 mg/kg rFc-µTP-L309C or human serum albumin (HSA). Flow cytometry was used to isolate the activated CD4<sup>+</sup>CD44<sup>+</sup> T-cells and T-regulatory cells (Tregs). Intracellular staining was used to identify Th1 and Th17 T-cell subsets, and CD4<sup>+</sup>CD25<sup>+</sup>FoxP3<sup>+</sup> Tregs. ELISA was used to measure levels of IL-10 and TGF-β in synovial fluid. <b>Results:</b> We find that amelioration of the arthritis occurs after treatment with rFc-µTP-L309C and results in a decrease in Th1 cells' production of IFNγ and Th17 cells' production of IL-17. Amelioration also results in decreased production of GM-CSF. Moreover, amelioration results in increased Tregs and IL-10 production in the synovial fluid. <b>Conclusions:</b> rFc-µTP-L309C reduces the inflammatory T-cells and increases the regulatory anti-inflammatory T-cells in the chronic arthritis K/BxN mouse model. This effect explains, in part, the ability of rFc-µTP-L309C to ameliorate the arthritis and reduce damage on the articular cartilage of K/BxN mice."
"<b>Background/Objectives</b>: MicroRNAs (miRNAs) have emerged as molecular mediators involved in the pathogenesis of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Given the influence of diet on gene expression and inflammation, plant-based diets represent a potential non-pharmacological strategy for modulating disease activity. This study aimed to explore and validate, through a bioinformatic-guided pilot approach, the regulation of miRNAs associated with RA in response to a 14-day plant-based dietary intervention. <b>Methods</b>: Candidate miRNAs were identified through differential expression analysis of the GSE124373 dataset using GEO2R and were further supported by a literature review. Target gene prediction and functional enrichment analyses were conducted to assess the biological relevance of these findings. Twenty-three RA patients followed a plant-based diet for 14 days. The clinical activity (DAS28-CRP), biochemical markers, and plasma expression of five selected miRNAs (miR-26a-5p, miR-125a-5p, miR-125b-5p, miR-146a-5p, and miR-155-5p) were evaluated before and after the intervention using RT-qPCR. <b>Results</b>: Significant reductions were observed in DAS28-CRP scores, C-reactive protein, glucose, and lipid levels after 14 days of intervention. Three of the five miRNAs (miR-26a-5p, miR-125a-5p, and miR-155-5p) were significantly downregulated post-intervention. Bioinformatic analyses indicated that these miRNAs regulate immune-inflammatory pathways relevant to RA pathogenesis. <b>Conclusions</b>: This pilot study suggests that a short-term plant-based dietary intervention may modulate circulating miRNAs and improve clinical and biochemical parameters in RA patients. These findings support further research into dietary strategies as complementary approaches for RA management."
"Fibroblast-like synoviocytes (FLSs) are critical for promoting joint and surrounding soft tissue damage in Rheumatoid arthritis (RA). β-Sitosterol has the potential to attenuate RA; however, the underlying mechanism remains largely unknown. This study aimed to investigate the effect of β-Sitosterol on the biological functions of FLSs. FLSs were isolated from the synovial tissues of patients with RA, and cellular behaviors were evaluated using cell counting kit-8, 5-ethynyl-2'-deoxyuridine, scratch test, and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The binding between β-Sitosterol and LDHA was evaluated using molecular docking and surface plasmon resonance. The lactylation of GPI was identified using immunoprecipitation (IP), western blotting, and protein stability assay. The results showed that β-Sitosterol suppressed FLS proliferation, migration, and the levels of IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α in a dose-dependent manner. Next, we found that β-Sitosterol bound to LDHA and decreased its protein levels. Moreover, overexpression of LDHA elevated the lactylation levels of GPI and increased GPI protein levels. Knockdown of GPI abrogated the effects on cellular behaviors induced by LDHA. In conclusion, β-Sitosterol inhibits the proliferation, migration, and inflammatory response of FLSs by suppressing LDHA-mediated lactylation of GPI, thereby attenuating RA. These findings provide insights into the molecular mechanisms of β-Sitosterol and suggest β-Sitosterol may be a therapeutic agent for RA."
"The fibroblast-like synoviocyte (FLS) has a central role in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) pathogenesis and its invasive behavior strongly correlates with disease severity and joint damage. Yet, the regulation of FLS invasiveness is incompletely understood. Distal-less homeobox 4 (DLX4) is a transcription factor implicated in cancer cell invasion and metastasis, and we considered that it might also be involved in the regulation of FLS phenotypes. siRNA was used to knockdown DLX4 in RA FLS, compared with a control siRNA. Cells were then studied in invasion, migration, proliferation and adhesion assays, and RNA was used for RNA sequencing and pathway analyses. siRNA knockdown of DLX4 significantly reduced RA FLS invasiveness (P = 0.028) and migration in the scratch/wound healing assay (P = 0.008). RNA sequencing analyses revealed that DLX4 knockdown significantly affected processes and pathways implicated genes involved in diverse types of cancer and in cancer biology, including cell invasion, cell cycle, DNA replication, transcription, p53 signal transduction, RHO GTPase signaling, regulation of cytokinesis, as well as response to oxygen levels and to oxidative stress. HMOX1 and SOD2 were among the genes with the most significantly increased expression, while CPNE3 and HADHA were among those with the most significantly decreased expression in FLS knocked down for DLX4 compared with controls. We describe a new role for DLX4 in the regulation of RA FLS behaviors relevant to disease pathogenesis and joint damage, and identify a new transcriptomic signature regulated by this gene. These findings raise the possibility that DLX4, or one of its target genes and pathways may become a target for treatment."
"To investigate the presence and bioactivity of lipopolysaccharides (LPS) in synovial fluid (SF) of osteoarthritis (OA) patients and elucidate mechanisms modulating their inflammatory potential. SF samples from 56 OA, 7 rheumatoid arthritis and 39 trauma patients were analysed for LPS concentration and bioactivity. Lipid A composition was assessed using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS). In a rat model, LPS was administered systemically for 32 days to evaluate its impact on joint degeneration. The interaction between LPS and synovial proteins, particularly fibronectin (Fn), was examined through in vitro assays and a 3D synovial membrane model. LPS was detected in all SF samples with comparable concentrations and lipid A profiles across all groups. LC-MS measurements indicated higher LPS levels than those obtained from standard endotoxin assays, suggesting limitations in conventional detection methods. Despite elevated LPS presence, bioactivity assays revealed minimal proinflammatory responses, implying the existence of intrinsic SF factors neutralising LPS. In vivo, prolonged systemic LPS exposure did not induce OA-like changes in rat joints. Notably, LPS colocalised with Fn in the synovial membrane, and Fn binding attenuated LPS bioactivity and hindered its migration in vitro. LPS is prevalent in SF across various joint conditions but exhibits low bioactivity, indicating it is not a primary driver of joint inflammation. Fn plays a crucial role in sequestering and neutralising LPS within the synovial environment, offering a protective mechanism against LPS-induced inflammation. These findings underscore the need for accurate LPS measurement techniques and suggest potential therapeutic targets for modulating joint inflammation."
"Folate-chitosan surface modification of PLGA-decorated mesoporous silica nanoparticles (FC-PLGA-MSNs) was implemented to improve the delivery of leflunomide (LEF) for the management of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). These nanoparticles were designed to address LEF's poor bioavailability and side effects, such as hepatotoxicity and gastrointestinal distress, by enhancing oral delivery and targetability to inflamed joints. Various MSNs were prepared and optimized with different levels of pH and silica precursor (TEOS). The optimized MSNs exhibited a size of 94.2 ± 3.3 nm, a zeta potential of -50.2 ± 4.5 mV, and a yield of 2.401 ± 0.17gm. Optimized MSNs were loaded with LEF with entrapment efficiency of 79.25 ± 3.84 %, subsequently coated with PLGA, and surface modified with folate-chitosan, producing FC-LEF-PLGA-MSNs demonstrating a nanometric size range and sustained drug release. The therapeutic efficacy of the FC-LEF-PLGA-MSNs was evaluated in a rat model of RA, showing significant antirheumatic effects compared to free and marketed LEF. Oral administration of the nanoparticles after RA induction significantly reduced joint swelling and histopathological damage. Additionally, the FC-LEF-PLGA-MSNs suppressed inflammatory cytokine levels, including TNF-α and IL-6, by 52.86 % and 55.12 %, respectively. These results demonstrate that FC-LEF-PLGA-MSNs provide an effective and safer alternative to free LEF for RA treatment."
"This study aims to identify autophagy-related biomarkers in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) synovium, analyze their immune infiltration characteristics, and validate therapeutic potential through multi-level experimental approaches. We used public datasets to obtain synovial tissue genes of healthy people and RA patients, screened differentially expressed genes (DEGs) of RA, and intersected with the human autophagy gene database (HADb) to obtain RA autophagy genes. GO and KEGG enrichment analysis and single-gene genome enrichment analysis were performed. The diagnostic value of RA core autophagy genes in the validation set was screened and verified. The immune cell correlation analysis of RA autophagy core genes was performed to obtain the correlation between single disease autophagy core genes and immune cells. Finally, we prepared CIA rat models to verify the autophagy protein P62, Beclin-1 and the 11 core genes associated with RA-autophagy. A total of 1098 RA DEGs were obtained. Intersecting with 222 autophagy genes obtained from the HADb database yielded 27 RA autophagy genes. GO analysis of RA autophagy genes showed 307 biological mechanisms. KEGG enrichment analysis obtained 86 signaling pathways, including FoxO, Necroptosis and other pathways related to RA autophagy. GSEA analysis found that the control group had a higher correlation with adipokine signaling pathways and others. And 11 RA autophagy-related core genes (IFNG, EGFR, MYC, CXCR4, MAPK8, CASP1, TNFSF10, CTSB, FAS, FOXO1, FOXO3) were obtained by screening the PPI network, and there were differences in expression in the training set (P < 0.001). External validation set verification showed diagnostic efficacy. Analysis of immune infiltration in RA autophagy-related genes revealed 14 immune cell types differentially abundant in synovial tissues of RA patients vs. normal controls. Significant correlations exist between autophagy genes and immune subsets. Finally, animal experiments showed that joint autophagy was enhanced (P < 0.001), and the mRNA of 11 RA-autophagy core genes had significant changes (P < 0.001). We systematically identified 11 autophagy-related core genes as potential therapeutic targets for RA. Our CIA model validation provides preclinical evidence supporting their translational potential. These genes showed significant correlations with 14 synovial immune cell subtypes, may serve as novel therapeutic targets by modulating immune infiltration and inflammatory pathways. Future investigations should focus on elucidating the mechanistic basis of the observed gene-immune cell interactions in both autophagic and immune pathways to facilitate the development of precision therapies."
"Methotrexate (MTX), the most common first-line treatment in rheumatoid arthritis, is often insufficient, with no model capable of predicting response. The RA classification criteria, including autoantibodies and inflammation, were applied to 257 patients with newly diagnosed inflammatory arthritis in the cohort study, estimating MTX response. A total of 172 patients received MTX as the first anti-rheumatic drug and response was recorded at 1 year follow-up. A multivariable logistic regression used variables distinct between MTX-responders and non-responders to build the predictive model of response. Overall, 53.5% of MTX treated patients responded. Non-responders were frequently autoantibody positive, and responders were older, had lower RA classification scores, frequent corticosteroid use, and high insulin levels at baseline. Inflammation parameters were comparable between the groups. In the multiple regression analysis, the RA classification score and age at the first visit were strong predictors of MTX response (AUC 0.697, <i>p</i> < 0.0001). Including blood levels of insulin and IFNg improved AUC to 0.782 (<i>p</i> < 0.0001), offering early discrimination between responders and non-responders with high accuracy. Cellular experiments showed that insulin could be used to estimate MTX response by demonstrating that insulin changed the transcription of MTX target genes in the folate metabolism after exposing CD4+ cells ex vivo, which could facilitate MTX response in immune cells."
"Mitochondria are central to immune regulation, inflammation, and cellular metabolism. Growing evidence suggests that mitochondrial dysfunction contributes to autoimmune disease (AD) pathogenesis by modulating inflammatory pathways and immune cell function. However, the causal relationships between mitochondria-related proteins and ADs remain unclear. We conducted a bidirectional two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis to examine causal associations between 67 mitochondria-related proteins and 10 ADs, using GWAS data from the IEU OpenGWAS and FinnGen databases. Colocalization analysis assessed whether genetic signals for mitochondrial proteins and ADs overlapped. Protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks and functional enrichment analyses were used to explore biological functions. Sensitivity analyses evaluated pleiotropy and heterogeneity to ensure robustness. MR analysis revealed significant causal associations, including SLC9B2 with rheumatoid arthritis (RA), MRM3 with ulcerative colitis (UC) and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), and PDK1 with UC and IBD. Reverse MR indicated bidirectional effects, with UC influencing SLC9B2 and C1QBP expression. Colocalization analysis confirmed shared genetic variants, linking mitochondrial proteins to inflammatory regulation. This study provides genetic evidence for the causal role of mitochondrial proteins in autoimmune inflammation, identifying potential biomarkers and therapeutic targets. Future research integrating multi-omic and functional validation is needed to advance mitochondria-targeted therapies for ADs.

"Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic inflammatory condition of the joints and a leading cause of global disability. However, the use of current anti-inflammatory treatments is often limited by serious side effects and multi-organ toxicity, necessitating the exploration of safer alternatives. This study aims to investigate the anti-rheumatic potential of natural compounds of Cassia angustifolia as small-molecule inhibitors of PTGS2. The therapeutic potential of C. angustifolia was evaluated through antioxidant and antiinflammatory assays. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) was used to identify its constituents. ADMET profiling (absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion, and toxicity), network pharmacology, and molecular dynamics simulation were employed to uncover the active compounds against PTGS2 for RA treatment. C. angustifolia extract contained significant phenolic (18.2 ± 0.008 mg GAE/g DW) and flavonoid (27.57 ± 0.03 mg RE/g DW) content. GC-MS yielded 288 compounds of which four passed the toxicity parameters. Protein-protein interaction analysis revealed 10 RA-related targets, with PTGS2 emerging as the most prominent one. Molecular docking and simulations revealed that compound-2 [2-Benzo [1,3] dioxol-5- yl-8-methoxy-3-nitro-2H-chromene] and compound-4 [alpha-hydroxy-N-[2-methoxyphenyl]-benzene propanamide] binds strongly with PTGS2 (-7.7 kcal/mol and -7.9 kcal/mol, respectively) predicting its stable interaction. C. angustifolia compounds present a significant potential as PTGS2 inhibitors, warranting further in vitro and in vivo investigations to confirm their therapeutic efficacy against RA."
"Osteitis on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and bone microstructure changes (BMC) on high-resolution peripheral quantitative computed tomography (CT) are the earliest signs of arthritis, preceding the development of bone erosion on X-ray in rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Recently, a Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitor, baricitinib, reportedly suppresses these early changes. This study aimed to elucidate the underlying molecular mechanism of osteitis and BMC using an animal model of RA and human samples. Osteitis and BMCs were assessed via MRI and micro-CT, respectively, in zymosan-treated SKG mice. Bone marrow (BM) cells were analysed via flow cytometry. JAK‒signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) cytokine expression was measured via performing quantitative PCR. Zymosan-treated SKG mice received baricitinib, anti-granulocyte‒macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) antibodies, or recombinant GM-CSF (r-GM-CSF). r-GM-CSF was also used in an in vitro osteoclast differentiation assay. Osteoclast differentiation was also investigated with human monocytes. Osteitis and BMCs occurred prior to arthritis in SKG mice. Granulocyte‒macrophage-lineage cells and osteoclast precursor cells (OCPs) expanded in the inflammatory BM. Receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa-B ligand-positive osteoclasts were observed at BMC sites. The expression of GM-CSF, a JAK‒STAT cytokine, was upregulated in osteitic BM. Both baricitinib and anti-GM-CSF antibodies suppressed osteitis and BMCs, whereas r-GM-CSF exacerbated these changes. In vitro addition of r-GM-CSF to osteoclast differentiation assay markedly increased the number and size of osteoclasts, especially when added in the late phase of osteoclast differentiation both in mice and humans. GM-CSF drives osteitis and BMCs by increasing granulocyte‒macrophage-lineage cells and OCPs and promoting osteoclast differentiation. Targeting GM-CSF is a potential therapeutic strategy to prevent early radiographic changes in RA."
"Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic and multifactorial inflammatory disease inducing damages in joints and extra-articular organs. Our previous study has revealed that Huayu-Qiangshen-Tongbi decoction (HQT) ameliorates RA through upregulating microRNA (miRNA) miR-125b-5p to suppress inflammation in rheumatoid fibroblast-like synoviocytes (FLSs). However, the mechanism of HQT increasing miR-125b-5p level in FLSs remains unclear. It has been reported that exosomal miR-125b-5p derived from adipose-derived stem cells (ADSCs) could ameliorate various diseases, yet the effect of exosomal miR-125b-5p derived from ADSCs on FLSs in RA under HQT treatment is largely unknown. The aim is to investigate whether HQT upregulated miR-125b-5p in FLSs through modifying exosomal miR-125b-5p derived from ASCs. Here, HQT-containing serum was prepared, co-culture of human FLS MH7A cells with ADSCs was performed, gene knockdown in ADSCs was assessed by short hairpin RNA (shRNA), protein degradation was identified after cycloheximide (CHX) treatment and ADSC-derived exosomes were collected to incubate MH7A cells and inject into RA rat model. HQT elevates lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-reduced miR-125b-5p level in FLSs by enhancing the secretion of exosomal miR-125b-5p derived from ADSCs. Besides, HQT attenuates inflammation of FLSs in RA by exosomal miR-125b-5p derived from ADSCs in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, HQT suppresses CD63 degradation in ADSCs to facilitate the release of exosomal miR-125b-5p derived from ADSCs. In summary, these findings reveal the mechanism of HQT elevating miR-125b-5p expression in FLSs and provide novel therapeutic strategy for RA treatment."
"Interstitial lung disease (ILD) is a common and severe comorbidity of rheumatoid arthritis (RA), yet reliable diagnostic biomarkers remain lacking. Alveolar type II (ATII) cells are widely recognized to play a key role in the pathogenesis of ILD. This study first aimed to screen and validate potential autoantigens involved in RA-ILD using ATII cells. Sera from multiple patient groups were subjected to immunoprecipitation with ATII cells and analyzed for candidate autoantigens related to RA-ILD through proteomic methods. Antibody concentrations in the sera were subsequently measured using protein chips and ELISA. Expression levels of target antigens in the lung tissues of collagen-induced arthritis-bleomycin (CIA-BLM) mice were evaluated via immunohistochemistry, while their expression in ATII-BLM cells was assessed using indirect immunofluorescence. The diagnostic value of these antibodies was further examined by ROC curve analysis. Preliminary studies also explored the cellular mechanisms involved. We identified exosome component 4 (EXOSC4) as a potential autoantigen in RA-ILD, with significantly higher levels of EXOSC4 antibodies found in the sera of RA-ILD patients. Moreover, EXOSC4 expression was elevated in the lung tissues of CIA-BLM mice and in ATII-BLM cells. Clinical assessments showed that the area under the curve (AUC) for EXOSC4 antibody in diagnosing RA-ILD was 0.809, increasing to 0.890 (95% CI:0.812–0.967) when combined with other clinical indicators. Notably, EXOSC4, Wnt 3a, and β-catenin expression were significantly upregulated in ATII-BLM cells as compared to ATII cells. Additionally, we found a significant interaction between naïve CD4 + T cells and ATII cells within the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway, suggesting a possible mechanistic role of EXOSC4 in RA-ILD pathogenesis. We identified EXOSC4 as a novel autoantigen associated with RA-ILD, which may assist in its clinical diagnosis."
"Macrophage activation syndrome (MAS) represents a severe and potentially life-threatening complication of adult-onset Still's disease (AOSD), necessitating the identification of sensitive and specific biomarkers for early diagnosis. Our study found significantly elevated CD64 mRNA expression in neutrophils of AOSD patients compared to healthy controls (p = 0.029). The neutrophil CD64 index (nCD64 index) positively correlated with key clinical manifestations, including splenomegaly, sore throat, pulmonary infiltrates, and pericarditis. Effective treatments led to a rapid and significant decrease in the nCD64 index (p < 0.001). Logistic regression showed that an elevated nCD64 index is a risk factor for MAS (OR = 1.073, p = 0.003). ROC curve analysis indicated that the nCD64 index reliably distinguished AOSD patients with MAS (AUC = 0.877; cutoff = 32.09; p < 0.001) and combined utilization of nCD64 index, ferritin, and sIL-2R demonstrated a strong predictive value. Correlations with hospitalization length (r = 0.382, p < 0.001) and maximum glucocorticoid dose (r = 0.326, p = 0.003) were also observed. Kaplan-Meier analysis revealed a significantly higher cumulative incidence of MAS in patients with an nCD64 index > 32.09 (p < 0.001). These findings suggest the nCD64 index is a promising biomarker for early identifying AOSD patients at risk of MAS, aiding in timely diagnosis and management."
"Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and Psoriatic arthritis (PsA) are systemic auto-immune diseases of unknown aetiology that lead to systemic inflammation and synovial joint destruction. Identification of specific serum proteins that selectively regulate these diseases, or which precede disease development could have great potential as disease biomarkers and predictors. Serum levels of C-reactive protein (CRP), sICAM-1, sVCAM-1, Serum amyloid A (SAA), Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs 1, 3 and 9) and metabolic markers: Active Glucose-dependent Insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP), active Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1), C-Peptide, Glucagon, Insulin, Leptin, Pancreatic Polypeptide (PP) were measured by Meso Scale Discovery (MSD) multiplex analysis assay. Serum levels of sICAM-1, MMP1, MMP3, PP, c-Peptide, CRP and SAA were specifically upregulated in RA, but not in PsA disease, displaying high sensitivity (ROC curves). In the early phase of the disease, these markers may be suitable for discriminating RA from PsA patients. Differences in sex, BMI, and disease activity were observed. This is the first study which directly compare serum metabolic markers between diseases and identifies specific disease signatures between RA and PsA. In addition, this study identified that CRP, SAA, GLP-1, GIP-1, Leptin and PP serum protein precede disease onset, as they are already altered in the serum of 'individuals at risk' of developing RA. Of these, CRP, SAA, Leptin and PP might predict IAR conversion to RA<sup>+</sup>, thus making them suitable candidates for disease prediction. Altogether, this study identifies selective serum markers associated with RA and PsA, which are pathotype-specific and are predictors of RA disease onset."
"Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic autoimmune disease that affects millions worldwide, characterized by joint pain, swelling, and functional impairment. Current treatments like Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), corticosteroids, and biologics, have limitations including side effects and resistance problems, which create a need for new therapeutic strategies. This study aims to explore the potential therapeutic role and mechanisms of Geniposide (GE), a natural compound extracted from Gardenia jasminoides, in RA treatment. Through network pharmacology methods and using target prediction databases including TCMSP, SwissTargetPrediction, Pharmmapper, and Batman, 330 potential targets of GE were identified. In RA, 1324 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified from the GSE55235 dataset. By intersecting the datasets, 53 shared targets were identified, which were further analyzed using Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) enrichment, with pathways like IL-17 and JAK-STAT being significantly highlighted. Additionally, protein-protein interaction (PPI) network analysis identified 12 key targets (EGFR, MMP-9, CCL5, PPARG, STAT1, HCK, SYK, MAPK8, CTSB, RAC2, JAK2, TYMS) with high degree values. Furthermore, molecular docking studies confirmed strong binding affinities between GE and the identified targets. Experimental validation demonstrated that GE inhibited RA-FLS cell proliferation in a dose-dependent manner by using MTT assays and reduced the level of pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-17, IL-8, TNF-α, MMP-3, MMP-9) as measured by ELISA. RT-qPCR and Western blot analyses further confirmed that GE modulated the mRNA expression of key targets and inhibited the phosphorylation of JAK1 and STAT1 proteins, respectively. Finally, we verified the anti-inflammatory effect of GE on CIA mice through in vivo experiments. These findings suggest that GE has anti-RA effects by targeting several key molecules and pathways. This provides a theoretical basis for developing GE as a novel therapeutic for RA."
"Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is an autoimmune disease that often evolves over several years, which in the presence of risk factors, is termed the at-risk phase. Several of the currently approved treatments for RA have been evaluated for the prevention of RA during the at-risk phase, but without showing effects sufficient to warrant their use prior to diagnosis. There is an ongoing surge in research efforts to understand mechanisms underlying the onset of RA, in particular concerning deviations in the adaptive immune system and the role of mucosal surfaces in the breach of self-tolerance and triggering of arthritis. With this focus, we here aimed to review current knowledge on RA development prior to arthritis onset. Also, since the pre-arthritis phase may contain windows of opportunity to prevent RA onset, we present and conceptualise different strategies to potentially interfere with steps leading to RA. While the body of knowledge is increasing, our understanding of RA development remains incomplete, and available studies highlight that RA appears similarly heterogeneous prior to onset as is seen after diagnosis. Hence, the timing and the selection of subjects will be crucial for the success of future potential interventions."
"To investigate whether serum C1M and C2M, biochemical markers of synovial and cartilage tissue destruction, were associated with progression of joint damage in patients with early arthritis. 813 early arthritis patients (<6 months of symptoms, 82% with rheumatoid arthritis, 18% undifferentiated arthritis) from the prospective ESPOIR study were followed for 5 years. Radiographic progression was assessed using the van der Heijde Sharp score, and progression was defined as an increase of 1 or 5 unit(s) between baseline and 1 year or 5 years. Associations between baseline C1M and C2M and progression were assessed by logistic regression. Increased baseline continuous serum C1M levels were associated with the risk of progression at 1 year, after adjustment for age, gender and body mass index (BMI). Patients with levels in the highest quartile of C1M had an OR (95% CI) of total joint damage progression of 2.75 (1.70-4.45) compared with patients in the lowest quartile. When disease activity score 28, C reactive protein and anticyclic citrullinated peptide 2 antibodies positivity were included in the model, high C1M remained significantly associated with progression with an OR (95% CI) of 2.12 (1.06-4.23). At 5 years, C1M was significantly associated with the risk of total joint damage progression after adjustment for age, gender and BMI. There was no significant association of C2M with progression at 1 year or 5 years. High baseline serum C1M, but not C2M, is associated with increased radiographic progression in early arthritis, independently of classical risk factors. C1M, in conjunction with other risk factors, may help identify patients at higher risk of joint damage."
"The transient receptor potential vanilloid (TRPV) is a family of tetrameric cation channels, expressed in various tissues and cell types. It includes thermosensitive isoforms (TRPV1-4) and calcium-permeable members (TRPV5-6). In the context of autoimmune diseases, TRPV channels have been firmly established as pivotal regulators that bridge changes in the cellular environment to the immune system. Originally identified for their roles in thermosensation and nociception, these polymodal sensors have now emerged as crucial determinants of immune cell function. They are capable of converting chemical signals, temperature fluctuations, and mechanical forces into calcium-mediated signal transduction pathways. Mounting evidence indicates that dysregulated TRPV channel activity leads to pathological calcium influx, triggering a signaling cascade that reprograms the functions of key immune cells and modulates pain and itch signaling through neuroimmune crosstalk. These cascades amplify inflammatory responses, exacerbate autoimmune pathology, promote inflammatory cytokine release, and modulate pain/itch signaling via neuroimmune crosstalk. Specifically, these mechanisms are instrumental in the progression including autoimmune disorders, such as rheumatoid arthritis (RA), inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), systemic sclerosis (SSc), multiple sclerosis (MS), psoriasis, and atopic dermatitis (AD). Novel therapeutic strategies are emerging, aiming to modulate TRPV activity in autoimmune conditions. Approaches include suppressing hyperactive channels and leveraging their immunoregulatory potential. Promising preclinical results have highlighted that TRPV channels exhibit dual translational potential in mechanistic research of autoimmune diseases, integrating precise targeting with dynamic monitoring capabilities. However, translating these findings into clinical applications faces significant challenges, including differential effects on neuronal and immune signaling, as well as systemic side effects caused by disruptions to physiological homeostasis. This narrative review discuss how TRPV channel signaling has enhanced our understanding of autoimmune disease initiation. By dissecting how TRPV-mediated immune dysregulation drives pathological immune responses, we seek to offer novel mechanistic insights to inform the development of more effective and comprehensive treatment strategies for autoimmune diseases."
"Interleukin-9 (IL-9), the principal cytokine of Th9 cells, influences a vast range of functions due to the widespread expression of its receptor on various immune and non-immune cell types. Th9 cells and IL-9 play a detrimental role in the pathogenesis of some autoimmune diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Elevated Th9 cell numbers and higher IL-9 levels were observed in the peripheral blood and synovial tissues of patients with RA and animals with collagen-induced arthritis (CIA), correlating with disease activity. IL-9 can contribute to the pathogenesis of RA through multiple mechanisms, such as promoting the expansion and survival of pathogenic T cells; impairing the activity of regulatory T (Treg) cells; boosting the pathogenic responses of Th1 and Th17 cells; prolonging the survival and increasing the activity of synovial neutrophils; supporting the differentiation and activation of osteoclasts; enhancing the proliferation and survival of fibroblast-like synoviocytes (FLS); inducing the secretion of pro-inflammatory mediators from FLS; facilitating the polarization of pro-inflammatory M1 macrophages; and promoting the expansion of Th9 cells. Experimental and clinical evidence suggests that targeting IL-9/IL-9R and Th9 cells may be a promising approach for RA treatment. In addition, treatment with mesenchymal stem cells and various therapeutic agents showed beneficial effects in RA by downregulating inflammatory responses, such as Th9 cells and IL-9. This review provides a comprehensive explanation regarding the role of Th9 cells/IL-9 in RA pathogenesis and potential therapeutic approaches based on experimental and clinical findings."
"<i>Porphyromonas gingivalis</i> (<i>P. gingivalis</i>) is the major cause of chronic periodontitis and is associated with systemic diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis. A better understanding of the interplay of the human immune system and <i>P. gingivalis</i> lipopolysaccharide (LPS) may result in novel treatment and prevention strategies. Twelve LPS fragments of <i>P. gingivalis</i> were synthesized using automated glycan assembly, with the help of remote benzoyl ester participation to introduce 1,2-<i>cis</i>-glycosidic linkages. Saliva and sera derived from periodontitis patients, treated periodontitis patients, and healthy patients were screened for IgG and IgA antibodies using glycan microarrays. A tetrasaccharide antigen, α-d-Galp-(1→6)-α-d-Glcp-(1→4)-α-l-Rhap-(1→3)-2-β-d-GalNAc was identified as a glycoconjugate vaccine lead against <i>P. gingivalis</i> and elicited strong glycan-specific IgG responses in mice, showing binding to <i>P. gingivalis</i> W50 and suggesting potential for both targeted protection and broader prevention of systemic diseases linked to periodontitis."
"Chronic inflammatory diseases, like rheumatoid arthritis (RA) have been described to cause central nervous system (CNS) activation. Less is known about environmental factors that enable the CNS to suppress peripheral inflammation in RA. Here, we identified gut microbiota-derived histamine as such factor. We show that low levels of histamine activate the enteric nervous system, increase inhibitory neurotransmitter concentrations in the spinal cord and restore homeostatic microglia, thereby reducing inflammation in the joints. Selective histamine 3 receptor (H3R) signaling in the intestine is critical for this effect, as systemic and intrathecal application did not show effects. Microglia depletion or pharmacological silencing of local nerve fibers impaired oral H3R agonist-induced pro-resolving effects on arthritis. Moreover, therapeutic supplementation of the short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) propionate identified one way to expand local intestinal histamine concentrations in mice and humans. Thus, we define a gut-CNS-joint axis pathway where microbiota-derived histamine initiates the resolution of arthritis via the CNS."
"We present a case of Mirizzi syndrome in a patient who exhibited abdominal pain along with signs of obstructive jaundice. The minimally invasive approach was complicated, necessitating an open laparotomy, which ultimately prolonged the hospital stay. A female in her early 60s with a history of rheumatoid arthritis (on methotrexate) and hypothyroidism presented to the emergency department with jaundice as her chief complaint. Upon arrival, the patient was vitally stable. The only pertinent finding was scleral icterus. Laboratory results revealed AST of 263 U/L, ALT of 233 U/L, ALP of 1246 U/L, GGT of 342 U/L, total bilirubin of 5.8 mg/dL, and direct bilirubin of 4.6 mg/dL. Abdominal ultrasound showed dilated intrahepatic and extrahepatic bile ducts, with a common bile duct measuring 16 mm, raising concern for biliary obstruction. Magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) showed marked intrahepatic ductal dilation resulting from extrinsic compression of the common hepatic duct (CHD) by impacted gallstones at the gallbladder neck, findings that are consistent with Mirizzi syndrome. Hence, endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) was deferred and she underwent subsequent laparoscopic cholecystectomy, which turned into open surgery, and ended up getting bile duct resection with hepaticojejunostomy. Her postoperative course got complicated with partial small bowel obstruction, which was managed conservatively. Mirizzi syndrome presents a formidable diagnostic and therapeutic challenge. Our experience with this particular case reinforces that laparotomy offers a safer and more effective approach for managing Mirizzi syndrome in similar circumstances."
"Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a persistent inflammatory condition, and electroacupuncture (EA) has been demonstrated to effectively reduce the symptoms associated with RA. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying the effects of EA in RA remained poorly understood. This study aimed to identify potential diagnostic biomarkers for RA and elucidated the molecular targets of EA by using bioinformatics analysis and machine learning algorithms in peripheral blood samples. We obtained datasets from the Gene Expression Omnibus(GEO) database containing samples from RA patients (GSE15573) and from RA patients after EA treatment (GSE59526) for bioinformatics analysis. Diagnostic biomarkers were identified using three distinct machine learning algorithms (LASSO, Random Forest and SVM-REF). A rat model of RA was established using Complete Freund's Adjuvant (CFA), and quantitative real-time PCR was performed to confirm the differential expression of identified diagnostic biomarkers and assess the modulatory impact of EA on these genes. Twenty-six genes were identified as differentially expressed following EA treatment. Three machine learning algorithms converged on ARHGAP17 and VEGFB as potential diagnostic biomarkers for RA, exhibiting robust diagnostic performance (AUC > 0.75) and consistent expression patterns across multiple RA cohorts (GSE17755, GSE205962 and GSE93272). Besides, EA treatment significantly increased the paw withdrawal threshold (PWT) and the peripheral blood expression of both ARHGAP17 and VEGFB in CFA rats. This study employed three machine learning algorithms to identify potential diagnostic biomarkers for the alleviation of RA by EA. The biomarkers demonstrated robust diagnostic performance across multiple validation datasets. Furthermore, animal experiments confirmed that EA exerted a favorable regulatory effect on these diagnostic biomarkers. The findings of this study provided novel therapeutic targets for the EA treatment of RA."
"Interleukin-6 (IL-6) is a cytokine with pro- and anti-inflammatory functions. Interestingly, its divergent biological activities are mediated by different signaling pathways: In IL-6 classic signaling, which is associated with the regenerative and anti-inflammatory properties of the cytokine, IL-6 binds to and signals via the membrane-bound IL-6 receptor (IL-6R) on its target cells. In contrast, the pro-inflammatory properties of IL-6 are mediated via the soluble (s)IL-6R (IL-6 trans-signaling). Recently, a third mode of IL-6 signaling was revealed, which was termed cluster signaling and is required for the generation of pathogenic Th17 cells. In all pathways, intracellular signaling cascades are activated via the formation of a gp130 homodimer. The involvement of IL-6 in the pathogenesis of inflammatory diseases, autoimmune diseases and even cancer has made IL-6 and the IL-6R important therapeutic targets. Consequently, antibodies that block either IL-6 itself or the IL-6R are in clinical use and have been approved for different inflammatory diseases, including rheumatoid arthritis (RA). This review gives an overview about the complex biology of this important cytokine, summarizes the current usage of anti-IL-6 therapeutics in clinical use and highlights the pre-clinical and clinical development of novel therapeutic agents that specifically block only the trans-signaling pathway of IL-6."
