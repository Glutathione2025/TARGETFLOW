Abstract
"Small extracellular vesicles derived from umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells (UC-sEvs) may be used for the treatment of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) because of their ability to control inflammation and inhibit fibrosis. However, the lack of clarity regarding the treatment mechanism of IPF and the corresponding quality standards limit the clinical application of these small extracellular vesicles. Here, we established a good manufacturing practice (GMP) grade process for isolating UC-sEvs, and RNA-seq was performed to screen for potential therapeutic cargo in the product to confirm the therapeutic effect of nebulized UC-sEv agents against IPF. Functionally, UC-sEvs inhibited the pulmonary inflammatory response by regulating macrophage function, thereby suppressing the bleomycin toxicity-induced progression of fibrosis. Mechanistically, miR-146a-5p enrichment in UC-sEvs may be involved in alleviating bleomycin-induced IPF by targeting TRAF6/IRAK1 to negatively regulate inflammation. The proposed quality control strategy ensures the stability of the product across three batches, with RNA-seq analysis revealing highly similar miRNA expression profiles. The feasibility of using miR-146a-5p as a key therapeutic molecule has been validated. Finally, on the basis of the results of pharmacodynamics and key therapeutic molecule studies, we provided a detailed quality control standard for IPF therapy by nebulizing UC-sEv. These findings help understand how sEvs impact IPF and the possible consequences of their therapeutic usage and offer a quality standard reference."
"Fibrotic lung diseases such as idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) are caused by various forms of environmental injury and involve reciprocal interactions between activated (myo)fibroblasts and recruited monocyte-derived macrophages (MoMacs), collectively leading to progressive tissue remodeling. Extending previous findings implicating redox-based mechanisms in IPF pathogenesis, we here highlight the involvement of the NADPH oxidase (NOX) homolog DUOX1 in pulmonary fibrosis, based on observed increases in DUOX1 expression within fibrotic regions of IPF lung tissues or lung tissues from mice with experimentally induced pulmonary fibrosis, localized primarily to (myo)fibroblasts and recruited MoMacs. Building on a previous report implicating DUOX1 in myofibroblast activation, conditional DUOX1 ablation from myeloid cells (including macrophages) using LysM-Cre was found to dramatically attenuate fibrosis, highlighted by impaired MoMac recruitment, reduced collagen production, and improved oxygen saturation. A macrophage-intrinsic role of DUOX1 was further supported by its observed contribution to in vitro migration of bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDM) and to profibrotic BMDM activation, the latter including production of several epidermal growth factor receptor ligands involved in macrophage-fibroblast cross-talk. Finally, these DUOX1-mediated actions were associated with oxidative activation of Src kinase via cysteine oxidation, and were inhibitable by saracatinib, a clinically used Src inhibitor. Collectively, our findings highlight the involvement of DUOX1 in macrophage-(myo)fibroblast crosstalk in the pathogenesis and/or progression of pulmonary fibrosis, implicating it as a putatively novel therapeutically targetable feature of this devastating disease."
"This study aimed to comprehensively compare the lung disease phenotypes between single-dose and repetitive-dose bleomycin (BLEO)-induced mouse models of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). Male C57BL/6JRj mice were randomized and stratified to treatment according to body weight. Mice received either a single intratracheal instillation of BLEO (n = 14) or a repetitive regimen involving bi-weekly BLEO instillations over 4 weeks (n = 30). Two weeks after the last BLEO dose, mice were assigned as baseline (n = 13) or repetitive BLEO-IPF mice (terminated 8 weeks after baseline, n = 17). Saline-treated mice served as healthy controls (n = 10 per model). The repetitive BLEO-IPF mouse demonstrated sustained features of lung fibrosis, including persistent increases in lung hydroxyproline content, Ashcroft scores, and quantitative collagen levels 8 weeks after baseline. Histological analysis revealed ongoing pulmonary inflammation and accumulation of senescent myofibroblasts. Lung functional impairment was selective but persistent, with FEV0.1 being significantly reduced on study week 8. Lung transcriptome signatures in repetitive BLEO-IPF mice were comparable to those reported in end-stage IPF patients, albeit attenuated 8 weeks after baseline, suggesting initiation of reparative processes. The repetitive BLEO-IPF mouse model recapitulates histological features of progressive lung fibrosis with an evolving cellular senescence phenotype, offering a relevant preclinical platform for studying IPF pathophysiology and evaluating long-term effects of antifibrotic and senescence-targeted therapies."
"Interleukin-11 (IL-11), a member of the IL-6 cytokine family, plays a pivotal role in driving pulmonary inflammation, fibrosis, and cancer progression. As a distinct regulator, IL-11 exerts contrasting effects depending on the disease context. During acute inflammation, IL-11 maintains alveolar integrity, mitigates oxidative stress, and modulates immune responses. However, chronic IL-11 signaling promotes airway remodeling and fibrosis in diseases such as asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). We propose an ecological model in which IL-11 acts as a ""keystone species"" within interconnected pulmonary niches-epithelial, stromal, and immune cells-that collectively facilitate the transition from inflammation to fibrosis and ultimately to cancer. Targeted therapeutic strategies against IL-11 signaling are emerging, including neutralizing antibodies, receptor antagonists, engineered decoy ligands, and IL-11Rα-directed fusion toxins. Additionally, RNA interference (RNAi)-based approaches and small-molecule inhibitors targeting downstream IL-11 pathways (e.g., JAK/STAT3, MEK/ERK) have demonstrated substantial preclinical efficacy. This review underscores IL-11's critical role in pulmonary disease pathogenesis and highlights its potential as a therapeutic target. Further clinical validation and biomarker development are essential to translate these insights into personalized treatment strategies for diseases spanning inflammation, fibrosis, and cancer."
"CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein-β (C/EBPβ) may play a key role in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis progression. Despite this, the mechanism through which the formation of the transcriptional complex comprising C/EBPβ, signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3), and activator protein-1 (AP-1) impacts the regulation of connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) production by thrombin in human lung fibroblasts (WI-38) is not well understood. In this study, C/EBPβ knockdown suppressed thrombin-stimulated CTGF production and CTGF-luciferase activity. The phosphorylation and cytosol-to-nucleus translocation of C/EBPβ were enhanced by thrombin. C/EBPβ knockdown attenuated thrombin-induced STAT3-and AP-1-luciferase activity. Upon thrombin stimulation, the C/EBPβ/STAT3/AP-1 complex was bound to the CTGF promoter. Both the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) inhibitor and the dominant negative mutant of Akt inhibited thrombin-stimulated CTGF production, C/EBPβ phosphorylation, and C/EBPβ-luciferase activity. Furthermore, co-inhibition of the Akt, c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), and Janus kinase 2 (JAK2) did not further reduce thrombin-induced C/EBPβ-luciferase activity compared to inhibition of each pathway alone. In bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis, the phosphorylation of C/EBPβ, STAT3, and c-Jun in lung tissue was higher than the control group. In addition, the protein levels of C/EBPβ and CTGF, but not of c-Jun and STAT3, were higher than those in the control group. In conclusion, thrombin activates the PI3K/Akt pathway to activate C/EBPβ, which in turn induces CTGF expression in human lung fibroblasts. C/EBPβ/STAT3/AP-1 transcriptional complex formation plays an essential role in thrombin-triggered CTGF production. C/EBPβ upregulation and C/EBPβ/STAT3/AP-1 complex formation may play crucial roles in lung fibrosis and have potential for use as therapeutic targets."
"Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a chronic interstitial lung disease (ILD) characterized by progressive accumulation of extracellular matrix in the lung and dysregulated activation of specific signaling pathways. Recent advances in the understanding of the biological bases of IPF identified the silencing of secreted protein acidic and rich in cysteine (SPARC) as a key modulator in the pathogenesis of IPF, although the mechanisms underlying the SPARC aberrant modulation remain to be fully elucidated. Here we investigated the aberrant methylation at the promoter gene region as a possible mechanism of SPARC deregulation in IPF. Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissues from a cohort of 44 patients with IPF and from a control-group of 23 non-idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (NIPF) were analyzed. DNA methylation analysis at the <i>SPARC</i> promoter region was assessed by quantitative methylation-specific PCR analysis (QMSP) and a total of 11 CpGs located in the gene promoter island were evaluated. Methylation levels were found to be significantly higher (p < 0.004, Mann-Whitney test) in 44 IPF samples (methylated using the optimal cut-off 20/44, 45%) compared to NIPF surgical biopsies (methylated using the optimal cut-off 3/23, 13%). At the <i>in vitro</i> level, we observed an inverse correlation between SPARC mRNA levels and hypermethylation under 5-Aza-2'-deoxycytidine (5-Aza-CdR) treatment when a primary fibrotic cell line was treated, whereas any variations were observed treating non-fibrotic cells. Our explorative study suggests that promoter methylation of the <i>SPARC</i> gene is linked to IPF but not to NIPF, and could represent a potential molecular marker of disease, thus warranting further investigations on larger cohorts."
"Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a progressive and fatal disease with undefined etiology and minimally effective therapies. The greatest risk factor for developing IPF is aging. The central paradigm to developing antifibrotic drugs for the last half century has focused on directly targeting proliferative lung fibroblasts. However, recent high-resolution analyses of IPF patient lungs suggests disease unique populations of resident lung cells are enriched for markers of senescence. Published work by our group and others further supports that senescent cells are key drivers of fibrosis and may provide an opportunity to develop an effective antifibrotic drug. Multiple naturally derived flavonoids can selectively induce apoptosis in senescent cells (senolytic) and improve end points in models of lung fibrosis; however, these natural phytochemicals are not structurally optimized to maximize their translational potential. Inspired by this opportunity we have performed hit-to-lead studies and medicinal chemistry optimization to generate a novel synthetic flavanoid (F-4N) with ∼ 50× greater senolytic potency in vitro- compared to fisetin or quercetin, two naturally derived senolytic flavonols. Furthermore, in bleomycin injury models of lung fibrosis we have shown treatment with F-4N (10 mg/kg-30 mg/kg, daily) promotes reduced senescence burden, resolution of chronic lung fibrosis, and markers of enhanced alveolar epithelial repair."
"Pulmonary fibrosis is a progressive interstitial lung disease characterized by excessive extracellular matrix (ECM) deposition, resulting in impaired respiratory function. Due to the limited efficacy of current antifibrotic therapies, there is an urgent need to develop novel agents or optimize existing drugs. In this study, a series of pirfenidone (PFD) derivatives were rationally designed and synthesized with targeted modifications at the third position of the core scaffold to enhance antifibrotic efficacy. A total of 30 derivatives (100 μM) were screened using a TGF-β-induced differentiation model, leading to the identification of hit compounds with superior activity compared to PFD (500 μM). Selected candidates were further validated both in vitro (LL29 and DHLF cells) and in the bleomycin (BLMN)-induced pulmonary fibrosis mouse model. In vitro, compounds <b>6a</b> and <b>10b</b> (50 and 100 μM) demonstrated robust suppression of fibrotic markers, as confirmed by RT-qPCR and immunofluorescence, indicating a dose-dependent antifibrotic effect. In vivo, BLMN administration significantly increased the lung index and fibrotic marker expression. In contrast, compounds <b>6a</b> and <b>10b</b> significantly downregulated the expression of fibrotic markers (including FN1, α-SMA, and collagen1α1). Histopathological analysis revealed that compound <b>10b</b> effectively mitigated BLMN-induced alveolar wall thickening and collagen deposition, and significantly restored lung function in a dose-dependent manner, outperforming the PFD group. Mechanistic studies further indicated that <b>10b</b> exerts its effects through modulation of the SMAD3/SMAD7 signaling pathway. Additionally, compound <b>10b</b> exhibited a pharmacokinetic profile comparable to PFD. Collectively, these findings support compound <b>10b</b> as a promising antifibrotic candidate with strong potential for clinical translation."
"Cryptogenic organizing pneumonia (COP), formerly called bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia (BOOP), was first described in the 1980s and is classified as a rare idiopathic interstitial pneumonia (IIP). COP classically presents in a subacute fashion following a flu-like illness with fever, non-productive cough, and fatigue. Imaging often reveals diffuse, bilateral, peribronchovascular and peripheral consolidative and ground glass opacities although various imaging subtypes also exist. Physical exam may be normal or reveal inspiratory crackles. Hypoxemia, when present, is commonly identified with exertion but can also occur at rest. Diagnostic evaluation relies on excluding secondary causes of organizing pneumonia and includes a thorough history including medications, exposures, and signs or symptoms of underlying rheumatologic disease. Invasive diagnostic testing including tissue sampling allows for histopathologic confirmation of COP while excluding secondary causes including infection and malignancy. While video-assisted thorascopic surgery (VATS) lung biopsy is often the preferred method of obtaining sufficient tissue, less invasive means may be employed based on patient-specific factors. A defining feature of COP is steroid-responsiveness, and most experts recommend prolonged corticosteroid courses (6-12 months). Response to corticosteroids and prognosis is typically excellent. Relapse rates range from 25-50% and occur most often during steroid taper or complete withdrawal necessitating additional therapy. Steroid-sparing immunosuppression may be used in select circumstances. Further study is needed to define optimal corticosteroid dose and duration."
"Pulmonary fibrosis is a fatal condition marked by excessive extracellular matrix deposition and myofibroblast activation, with paraquat (PQ) being a potent inducer via oxidative stress and profibrotic signaling. This study evaluated the antifibrotic effects of disulfiram (DSF), an FDA-approved medication, in rats with PQ-induced pulmonary fibrosis. Forty male Wistar rats were divided into eight groups receiving PQ (40 mg/kg) and DSF (1, 10, 100 mg/kg) for 21 days. Lung tissues were analyzed histopathologically (H&E, Mallory's trichrome) for inflammation, alveolar septal thickening, vascular congestion, and fibrosis, while Zeb1 gene expression was assessed by real-time PCR. PQ exposure led to severe lung injury, collagen deposition, and significant upregulation of Zeb1 (p = 0.0022). DSF at 10 mg/kg provided the most effective protection, significantly reducing histopathological damage and Zeb1 expression (p < 0.001). The 1 mg/kg dose showed moderate efficacy, and the 100 mg/kg dose had limited benefits, suggesting a dose-dependent toxicity. These findings indicate that DSF at 10 mg/kg attenuates PQ-induced pulmonary fibrosis by reducing inflammation, collagen accumulation, and Zeb1-mediated profibrotic signaling, supporting DSF as a potential repurposed antifibrotic therapy for PQ-induced and possibly idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis."
"This meta-analysis evaluates the prevalence of primary graft dysfunction (PGD) and its risk factors after lung transplantation (LT). We searched databases (PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, Web of Science) up until May, 2024. STATA 16 was used for data analysis. Random or fixed effects models were used to summarize the prevalence of PGD and associated risk factors according to statistical tests for heterogeneity. Risk of bias was assessed with the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. A total of 61 studies with 59,865 patients were included. The pooled prevalence of grade 2 and grade 3 PGD was 27% (95% CI 0.19, 0.34) and 18% (0.16, 0.21), respectively. Donor-related risk factors included older age (OR = 1.04; 95% CI 1.00, 1.58), female gender (OR = 1.67; 95% CI 1.13, 2.48), and smoking history (OR = 1.84; 1.47, 2.30). Recipient factors were female gender (OR = 1.51; 95% CI 1.32, 1.74), higher BMI (OR = 1.22; 95% CI 1.11, 1.33), idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (OR = 2.08; 95% CI 1.64, 2.63), and pulmonary hypertension (OR = 2.19; 95% CI 1.50, 3.21). Operative risks included higher reperfusion FiO<sub>2</sub> (OR = 1.13; 95% CI 1.01, 1.23), prolonged ischemic time (OR = 1.03; 95% CI 1.01, 1.05), and cardiopulmonary bypass use (OR = 2.38; 95% CI 1.79, 3.16). This study highlights the donor, recipient, and operative factors contributing to PGD risk, and emphasizes the need for targeted strategies in high-risk populations and further mechanistic research."
"To assess whether a panel of peripheral blood biomarkers associated with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is also associated with interstitial lung disease (ILD) in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) utilizing three independent cohorts. We first assessed the association of a panel of IPF-associated biomarkers with prevalent ILD among two separate RA cohorts (n=93 and n=71). Concentrations of eight IPF-related biomarkers (eotaxin, Flt-3L, IL-8, MDC, MCP-1, and MMP-2/7/9) were measured, standardized, and summed to generate a multibiomarker score. We subsequently validated the association of this score (minus MMP-2) with prevalent and incident ILD in an independent multicenter, prospective cohort of US Veterans with RA (n=2,507). Multivariable regression models were adjusted for relevant covariates in the validation cohort. In both development cohorts, participants with RA-ILD had significantly higher IPF multibiomarker scores than those with RA alone. In the independent validation cohort, participants with the highest quartile multibiomarker scores had a significantly higher likelihood of prevalent ILD (adjusted odds ratio 2.14 [95% CI 1.18-3.87]) and incident ILD (adjusted hazard ratio 2.45 [95% CI 1.55-3.88]) than those in the lowest quartile. The cumulative hazard of incident ILD approached 20% by 15 years for those in the highest quartile compared to <10% for all other quartiles. A multibiomarker panel derived from IPF-associated biomarkers was associated with RA-ILD in separate development and validation cohorts. This overlap supports the concept of shared etiopathogenesis of IPF and RA-ILD and illustrates the potential for peripheral blood biomarker panels to stratify ILD risk among RA patients."
"Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a progressive and fatal interstitial lung disease for which reliable early diagnostic biomarkers are still lacking. This study aimed to evaluate the diagnostic and monitoring value of induced sputum Krebs von den Lungen-6 (KL-6) levels in patients with IPF and to investigate their relationship with pulmonary function parameters and high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) scoring. In this prospective observational study, 20 patients with IPF and 20 age-matched healthy subjects (HS) were enrolled between October 2021 and April 2023. Induced sputum samples were collected for KL-6 measurement using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, while all participants underwent pulmonary function testing and HRCT scoring. KL-6 levels were significantly higher in the IPF group compared with the HS group [776.29 (interquartile range, IQR: 681.98-858.57) vs. 322.21 (IQR: 253.67-338.64) U/mL, p<0.001]. In IPF patients, induced sputum KL-6 levels showed strong negative correlations with multiple lung function indices, including forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1), forced vital capacity (FVC), and diffusing capacity for carbon monoxide (DLCO) (all p<0.05), and a strong positive correlation with HRCT scores (r=0.908, p<0.001). Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis demonstrated that combining KL-6 levels with HRCT scores yielded an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.936 (95% confidence interval, CI: 0.914-0.944), with specificity of 97.5% and sensitivity of 80.0%. In conclusion, induced sputum KL-6 levels reflect the degree of pulmonary fibrosis and are closely associated with functional and imaging indicators in IPF. The combination of KL-6 with HRCT scoring enhances diagnostic accuracy, underscoring its potential clinical utility as a noninvasive biomarker for early detection and monitoring of IPF."
"<b>Background/Objetives</b>: Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a progressive interstitial lung disease with poor prognosis. Nutritional disorders, particularly cachexia, significantly impact morbidity and mortality in IPF but remain under-investigated. This study aimed to characterize cachexia phenotypes in IPF through morphofunctional assessment (MFA) and to evaluate their prognostic relevance, including the role of mitochondrial biomarkers. <b>Methods</b>: In this prospective bicenter study, 85 IPF patients underwent MFA including bioelectrical impedance vector analysis (BIVA), nutritional ultrasound (NU), and T12-level computed tomography (T12-CT) for body composition. Functional and strength assessments included timed up and go test (TUG) and handgrip strength (HGS), respectively. Cachexia was defined by Evans' criteria, Martin's CT-based criteria, and our IPF-specific proposed definition. Serum GDF-15 and PGC-1α levels were also measured. <b>Results</b>: Cachexia prevalence varied by definition: 24.71% (Evans), 29.5% (Martin) and 42.4% (IPF Cachexia Syndrome). Cachectic patients showed significantly lower muscle mass, function, and quality (measured by reduced muscle attenuation at T12-CT), along with higher GDF-15 and lower PGC-1α levels. The presence of IPF Cachexia syndrome (HR 2.56; 95% CI, 1.08-6.07; <i>p</i> = 0.033), GDF-15 > 4412.0 pg/mL (HR 3.21; 95% CI, 1.04-9.90; <i>p</i> = 0.042) and impaired TUG (>8 s) (HR 3.77; 95% CI, 1.63-8.71; 0.002) were all independently associated with increased 24-month mortality. <b>Conclusions</b>: Cachexia is prevalent in IPF and showed strong concordance between the three diagnostic criteria. The IPF Cachexia syndrome, based on comprehensive morphofunctional phenotyping, demonstrated superior discriminatory capacity. The addition of mitochondrial biomarkers may improve early detection and support personalized interventions to improve patient outcomes."
"Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a chronic, progressive interstitial lung disease characterized by aberrant tissue remodeling and excessive deposition of extracellular matrix components. Emerging evidence underscores the critical role of the immunometabolism in the pathogenesis of IPF, highlighting how dysregulated metabolic pathways modulate immune responses and contribute to fibrotic progression. Key molecular regulators such as PPARG (peroxisome proliferator activated receptor gamma) and SPP1 (secreted phosphoprotein 1), along with signaling pathways including mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), and hypoxia-inducible factor 1-alpha (HIF-1α), orchestrate immune cell polarization, fibroblast activation, and extracellular matrix production. These insights reveal promising therapeutic targets at the intersection of metabolism and immunity. This review synthesizes current findings on immunometabolism interactions in IPF, emphasizing the potential of metabolic reprogramming and immune modulation as novel treatment strategies. Despite substantial advances, significant challenges persist in elucidating the precise mechanisms underlying these interactions and translating preclinical insights into effective clinical interventions. Future research should prioritize the identification of actionable metabolic biomarkers, refinement of molecular targets, and development of personalized therapeutic approaches. Addressing these gaps may pave the way for innovative therapies capable of halting or even reversing fibrosis, ultimately improving outcomes for patients with IPF."
"Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a chronic and progressive fatal disease characterized by the activation of lung fibroblasts (LFs). Wogonoside (WG), a natural compound with multiple pharmacological properties including anti-fibrotic activities, shows promise in treating IPF. This study aims to investigate the pharmacological effects and underlying mechanisms of WG on LF activation and the progression of IPF. Initially, we validated the anti-fibrotic properties of WG using a bleomycin (Bleomycin)-induced IPF model in mice, followed by RNA sequencing to identify its pharmacological targets. Subsequent in vitro experiments assessed the activities of key enzymes involved in the whole processes of glycolysis and lactic acid production, the changes of cellular energy metabolism and mitophagy-related pathways in LFs treated with transforming growth factor beta (TGF-β) or WG. Finally, reverse validation experiments were performed by further administration of lactic acid or cyclosporin A (CsA) into mice. We demonstrated that WG reduced the production of lactic acid and the lactylation of lactate of snail homolog 1 (Snail1) at K9 site by promoting pyruvate kinase isozymes R/l (PKLR) and inhibiting glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), while triggered mitophagy and reduced reactive oxygen species production and mtDNA release by promoting peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator 1α (PGC1α) and PTEN-induced kinase 1 (PINK1)/PARKIN pathways. These two processes compatibly inhibited the TGF-β transcription and ultimately LF activation, which were reversed by lactic acid supplementation or mitophagy depletion in mice. Overall, our findings first underscore the potential pharmacological benefits of WG in the treatment of IPF by impeding lactate accumulation and mitophagy damage, thereby providing a novel theoretical framework for therapies targeting pulmonary diseases."
"To facilitate earlier access to palliative care (PC) for interstitial lung disease (ILD) patients, a combined ILD-PC clinic was launched at Royal Prince Alfred Hospital. We describe referral patterns and clinical practice 16 months post-implementation. A review of consecutive patients referred to the ILD-PC clinic was performed. Reasons for referral, PC interventions implemented and clinical outcomes were documented. 36 patients were referred to the ILD-PC clinic (75±8 years; 57% men). Diagnoses included idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (49%), unclassifiable ILD (14%), chronic hypersensitivity pneumonitis (14%) and connective tissue disease-associated ILD (11%). Reasons for referral included high symptom burden (91%), advanced disease (66%) and disease progression (49%). PC management strategies encompassed symptom management (60%), referral to community PC services (40%), advance care planning (26%) and the prescription of opioids and benzodiazepines (23%). During the follow-up period, 23% of patients self-reported worsening symptoms, 40% demonstrated lung function decline, 11% died and 6% were listed for lung transplantation. The ILD-PC clinic incorporates a multidisciplinary, patient-centred approach to ILD care by enabling early access to symptom management, community services and advance care planning."
"Interstitial lung abnormalities (ILAs) are common incidental findings in lung cancer screening (LCS). However, challenges remain in identifying clinically relevant ILAs as highlighted in a joint statement by a European multidisciplinary task force led by the European Respiratory Society (ERS). To address these challenges, we analysed ILAs identified in one of Europe's largest LCS studies. Of 11 635 LCS individuals, 417 screen-detected ILAs were evaluated using a new visual classification system focused on traction bronchiolectasis: non-fibrotic ILA (no traction bronchiolectasis), fibrotic ILA (traction bronchiolectasis in ≤2 lobes); undiagnosed interstitial lung disease (traction bronchiolectasis in >2 lobes). Observer agreement was compared with Fleischner Society ILA classification using Cohen's Kappa. An age, sex and smoking history-matched control group allowed the examination of associations between baseline ILA/UILD and comorbidities, forced vital capacity (FVC), hospitalisations (Student's t-tests) and mortality (univariable and multivariable Cox proportional hazards models). Our visual ILA classification showed superior interobserver agreement (K=0.76) versus the Fleischner ILA classification (K=0.64). ILA/UILD subjects had more prevalent comorbidities, increasing (vs controls) approximately 10 years prior to ILA/UILD diagnosis. Compared with controls, mortality rates were 6-fold higher for UILD participants and 3-fold higher for fibrotic and non-fibrotic ILA subtypes. On multivariable Cox regression analysis, ILA/UILD presence (HR=4.90, 95% CI =2.36 to 10.10, p<0.001) showed stronger independent associations with mortality than baseline FVC (HR=0.98, 95% CI =0.96 to 1.00, p=0.04). We demonstrate a new reproducible classification of clinically important ILA/UILDs in LCS populations. We highlight that FVC shows limited associations with mortality in ILA/UILD subjects. Increased multiorgan comorbidity in ILA/UILD subjects highlights a need for comprehensive early multisystem evaluation."
"Little is known about the characteristics of adults with bronchiectasis in France. A descriptive cross-sectional study was conducted to describe the characteristics of adults (≥18 years) with clinically-significant bronchiectasis, diagnosed on a combination of respiratory symptoms and CT scan findings, and followed in 18 participating centers. Data on, etiology, lung function, symptoms, microbiology, treatments and quality of life were collected. Between January 2016 and July 2022, 630 adults (females: 66 %; ≥55 years: 73.8 %) were included. Idiopathic and post-infective causes represented 33.0 % and 37.1 % respectively; COPD and asthma, which were present in 15.6 % and 23.6 % of subjects, were considered as causes of bronchiectasis in only 3.8 % and 2.9 %, respectively. Only 25 % had normal spirometry and 7.3 % required long-term oxygen therapy. Daily sputum production was present in 78.1 % and 29.0 % had a modified Medical Research Council (mMRC) dyspnea score ≥2. Positive bacterial sputum culture was found in 77.8 % of those with sputum samples (n = 455); including 157 (34.5 %) positive for Pseudomonas aeruginosa within the past year. During the year prior to study entry, 75.4 % of patients reported at least one respiratory exacerbation, 33.8 % had at least one hospitalization and 24.5 % received outpatient parenteral antimicrobial therapy (OPAT). Using the bronchiectasis severity index 26.0 %, 36.4 % and 37.6 % were considered as having mild, moderate and severe disease, respectively. In France, adults with bronchiectasis experience significant disease burden. Respiratory exacerbations are responsible for healthcare utilization and their prevention may require specialized multidisciplinary care and the development of novel therapeutic interventions."
"Lactate has emerged as a multifunctional signaling molecule regulating various physiological and pathological processes. Furthermore, lactylation, a newly identified posttranslational modification triggered by lactate accumulation, plays significant roles in human health and diseases. This study aims to investigate the roles of lactate/lactylation in respiratory diseases. Comprehensive literature analysis was conducted using PubMed database, utilizing a range of keywords including ""lactate"", ""lactylation"", ""lung"", ""pulmonary"", and ""disease"". Emerging evidence indicates that increased glycolytic flux, resultant lactate accumulation, and elevated lactylation levels play key roles in the pathogenesis of respiratory diseases, including lung cancer, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), acute lung injury/acute respiratory distress syndrome (ALI/ARDS), pulmonary hypertension (PH), and asthma. Under these conditions, the upregulation of glycolytic enzymes and increased lactate transport are observed. Elevated levels of lactate and lactylation profoundly influence multiple biological processes, such as inflammatory responses, immune cell activation, autophagy, ferroptosis, EMT, tumorigenesis, and fibrosis, and lactate/lactylation-targeted therapies have demonstrated therapeutic efficacy against diverse respiratory illnesses. Elevated levels of lactate and lactylation play key roles in the pathogenesis of various respiratory diseases, and lactate/lactylation-targeted therapies appear to be potential therapeutic strategies for these respiratory diseases."
"Complement anaphylatoxins C3a and C5a are potent immunomodulators whose impact extends well beyond their traditional roles in innate immunity. Acting through G protein-coupled receptors C3aR, C5aR1, and C5aR2, these peptides take part in coordinating immune cell recruitment, vascular tone, and tissue remodeling. Yet their functions are deeply context-dependent: while they play essential roles in microbial clearance and immune coordination, their overactivation contributes to immunopathology in a wide range of diseases. The anaphylatoxins play key roles in early pathogen containment but can also drive cytokine storm and tissue damage, as in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and bacterial sepsis. In autoimmune conditions, the anaphylatoxins promote leukocyte infiltration and complement-mediated tissue injury. In chronic diseases, they contribute to fibrosis in diabetic kidney disease and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, and anaphylatoxins disrupt neurovascular integrity in neurodegenerative diseases. In cancer, C3a and C5a shape the tumor microenvironment by facilitating immune evasion, angiogenesis, and metastasis. As complement-targeted therapies gain momentum in clinical settings-particularly in the treatment of genetic disorders, such as paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria, more recently COVID-19, and cancer-a deeper mechanistic understanding of C3a and C5a signaling is imperative as we advance closer toward precision medicine, and this review aims to inform future approaches for therapeutic complement modulation."
"Air pollution is a significant public health issue that impacts lung health, particularly in vulnerable populations such as children, the elderly, and individuals with pre-existing respiratory conditions. Both natural and anthropogenic sources of air pollution give rise to a variety of toxic compounds, including particulate matter (PM), ozone (O₃), sulfur dioxide (SO₂), nitrogen dioxide (NO₂), carbon monoxide (CO), and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). Exposure to these pollutants is strongly associated with the development and exacerbation of respiratory diseases, including asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), lung cancer, and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). Notably, early life exposure to pollutants such as PM, NO₂, and O₃ is linked to an increased risk of childhood asthma. Air pollution can mediate adverse effects through effects on receptor signaling pathways, particularly those involving G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) and Toll-like receptors (TLRs). Both of these receptor families play key roles in regulating pulmonary function and immune responses. GPCRs are involved in mediating cellular responses via cyclic AMP (cAMP), calcium and other second messengers, while TLRs initiate immune responses. Understanding how air pollutants and cigarette smoke alter GPCR and TLR function to contribute to lung disease is a critical area of study, as these receptors play central roles in regulating inflammation, immune responses, oxidative stress, airway remodeling and airway tone. Disruption of their signaling by pollutants can exacerbate respiratory conditions such as asthma and COPD. This review explores what is known about how air pollution impacts GPCR and TLR signaling, offers insights into the mechanisms underlying respiratory disease development and highlights potential therapeutic strategies aimed at mitigating the impact of air pollution on lung health."
"Interstitial lung disease (ILD) is a frequent manifestation of connective tissue diseases (CTDs) and is associated with high morbidity and mortality. Clinical practice guidelines to standardise screening, diagnosis, treatment and follow-up for CTD-ILD are of high importance for optimised patient care. A European Respiratory Society and European Alliance of Associations for Rheumatology task force committee, composed of pulmonologists, rheumatologists, pathologists, radiologists, methodologists and patient representatives, developed recommendations based on PICO (Patients, Intervention, Comparison, Outcomes) questions with grading of the evidence according to the GRADE (Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluations) methodology and complementary narrative questions agreed on by both societies. For both PICO and narrative questions, the Evidence to Decision framework was used to formulate the recommendations. The task force committee concluded with recommendations for 25 PICO and 28 narrative questions, regarding ILD in the context of systemic sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis (RA), idiopathic inflammatory myopathies, Sjögren disease (SjD), systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and mixed connective tissue disease (MCTD). In four narrative questions, regarding screening and assessment of risk for ILD progression in MCTD, SjD and SLE and one PICO question regarding pirfenidone in CTD-ILD other than RA-ILD, the task force had insufficient evidence to support recommendations. Screening, diagnostic, monitoring and treatment algorithms were developed based on the recommendations and usual clinical practice. We provide practical guidance by evidence-based recommendations to clinicians for each of the CTDs. In many cases there is low certainty or absence of evidence and we encourage further research to fill these gaps."

"Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis(IPF) is a chronic progressive interstitial lung disease characterized by a complex pathogenesis and limited treatment options. Although studies have indicated that lipid metabolism dysregulation is associated with the progression of IPF, the core regulatory mechanisms remain unclear. By integrating RNA sequencing data from the GEO database, we identified four key genes related to lipid metabolism: peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma(PPARG), secreted phosphoprotein 1(SPP1), caspase 3(CASP3), and platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule 1(PECAM1). Further validation using single-cell RNA sequencing revealed the cell-specific expression patterns of these genes. The results found that PPARG was significantly downregulated in alveolar macrophages while SPP1 was significantly upregulated. Mechanistic studies indicated that PPARG negatively regulated SPP1 expression, and the interaction between SPP1 and cluster of differentiation 44(CD44) activated intercellular signaling pathways that promoted fibrosis. Through network pharmacology and molecular docking, it was predicted that the bioactive components of the traditional Chinese medicine formula, namely Buyang Huanwu Decoction may target PPARG to modulate lipid metabolism pathways. In a bleomycin-induced rat model with IPF, this paper randomly divided the rats into six groups(control, group, model group, pirfenidone group, and low, middle, and high-dose groups of Buyang Huanwu Decoction). The results demonstrated that Buyang Huanwu Decoction treatment significantly improved tissue pathological damage, reduced collagen deposition, and alleviated lipid metabolism dysregulation. Western blot analysis confirmed that Buyang Huanwu Decoction mediated the upregulation of PPARG and inhibited the activation of the SPP1/CD44 pathway. The multi-omics study elucidated the role of the PPARG/SPP1/CD44 pathway as a key regulatory factor in lipid metabolism in IPF, providing evidence that Buyang Huanwu Decoction exerted its antifibrotic effects through this novel mechanism and thus offering new insights into the therapeutic prospects for IPF."
"The causal relationship between vitamin B12 deficiency anaemia and the risk of developing lung diseases remains unclear. This study aimed to clarify that relationship using Mendelian randomization (MR) with Bayesian weighting, focusing on pulmonary fibrosis (PF), idiopathic PF (IPF), eosinophilic asthma (EA), squamous cell lung cancer (LUSC), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and pulmonary embolism (PE). We analysed genome-wide association study (GWAS) data, applied five MR models with Bayesian methods to assess causality, and validated the results via sensitivity analysis. The MVMR method explores whether vitamin B12-deficient anaemia affects the pathogenesis of IPF independently of BMI. SMR was used to explore IPF-related pathogenesis, whereas a meta-analysis was used to consolidate LUSC MR findings across ethnicities. IVW analysis revealed a positive causal link between vitamin B12 deficiency anaemia status and the risk of developing PF [OR (95% CI) = 1.161 (1.021, 1.319), P = 0.023], IPF [OR (95% CI) = 1.176 (1.002, 1.380), P = 0.047 (Bayesian MR)] and EA [OR (95% CI) = 1.394 (1.084, 1.793), P = 0.010]. The results of the study demonstrate that the development of IPF is influenced by vitamin B12 deficiency independently of BMI. Conversely, vitamin B12 deficiency anaemia status was negatively associated with the development of LUSC [OR (95% CI) = 0.879 (0.760, 0.995), P = 0.001], and no causal association was detected between vitamin B12 deficiency anaemia status and the development of COPD or PE. The reverse MR analysis yielded nonsignificant results. The SMR analysis revealed a significant association between IPF onset and CUBN, a vitamin B12 target. Post-MR meta-analysis confirmed the credibility and homogeneity of these findings. Vitamin B12 deficiency anaemia is causally associated with the development of PF, IPF, and EA but is negatively associated with the development of LUSC. No causality was observed for COPD or PE. Notably, CUBN emerged as a key IPF-related gene, highlighting the intricate relationship between vitamin B12 status and pulmonary health."
"Ubiquitination is a modification prevalent in eukaryotic cells. Disruptions in ubiquitination processes can have detrimental effects, potentially leading to diseases that endanger life. E3 ubiquitin ligases specifically recognize substrate proteins during ubiquitin modification, regulating intracellular protein levels and functions through the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway or TGF-β signal transduction. In recent years, substantial evidence has emerged, emphasizing the pivotal role that E3 ubiquitin ligases play in the development of pulmonary fibrosis. Advancing our understanding of how E3 ubiquitin ligases interact with pulmonary fibrosis could reveal new therapeutic targets and treatments for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), as well as innovative approaches in diagnosis and therapy. This review explores known regulatory mechanisms and identifies E3 ligases that have been implicated in IPF development."
"Cellular senescence is a biological process in which the cell cycle is arrested in response to DNA damage caused by different endogenous and exogenous stimuli. In senescent cells, activation of intracellular cascade induces epigenetic, morphological and metabolic changes. Among them, senescent status is characterized by an alteration of the epigenome and the establishment of a peculiar senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP), which contributes to the extracellular matrix remodeling and senescence spreading. Growing interest is directed towards senescence relevance both in physiological processes and in pathological ones, including rare progeroid syndromes. However, little is known about senescence contribution to the onset and development of rare diseases in which aging traits are not manifested. Here, we review the current knowledge about senescence involvement in four rare mendelian disorders of the epigenetic machinery (i.e. chromatinopathies) and four rare lung diseases, that can be considered a paradigm for understanding how epigenome alteration and aberrant microenvironment modification in senescence process might drive disease onset and progression. First, we report the main characteristics of chromatinopathies and the relation between the chromatin-related epigenetic defects and the senescence features in Sotos syndrome, Cornelia de Lange syndrome, Rett syndrome, and Kleefstra syndromes. Thereafter, we describe the pathological alteration and senescence involvement in cystic fibrosis, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, pulmonary arterial hypertension and lymphangioleiomyomatosis, considering them as models of rare lung diseases in which accumulation of senescent cells and their proinflammatory SASP have a central role. Exploring the role of senescence in different and less common diseases might promote the understanding of the senescent process as a novel player in rare disorders, for a more comprehensive vision of their complexity and the suggestion of novel possible therapeutical targets."
"Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a chronic progressive form of interstitial lung disease (ILD) characterized by significant extracellular matrix deposition, alveolar damage, and tissue remodeling. Antagonists against the G-protein coupled receptor, lysophosphatidic acid receptor 1 (LPAR1) have shown efficacy in lung fibrosis preclinically and clinically. Here, we profile PIPE-791, a small molecule, orally bioavailable LPAR1 receptor antagonist, and show its effectiveness in several lung fibrosis-related contexts. In vitro, we used human lung fibroblasts and precision cut lung slices (PCLS) derived from donors with pulmonary fibrosis to test PIPE-791 efficacy in reducing markers of fibrosis. In vivo, we used bleomycin-induced lung fibrosis models to demonstrate PIPE-791 efficacy. In vitro PIPE-791 reduced LPA-induced collagen expression (IC<sub>50</sub> 1.1 nM) in human lung fibroblasts. We also show that LPAR1 is elevated in IPF lung tissue and that PIPE-791 significantly reduced several markers of lung fibrosis in PCLS as measured by gene expression and secreted biomarkers. Using in vivo receptor occupancy, we found that PIPE-791 has long association kinetics resulting in a 20-fold increase in potency when dosed 3 versus 24 h prior to radioligand administration. At 3 mg/kg, PIPE-791 was effective in significantly reducing markers of fibrosis and collagen expression in mouse bleomycin models. We show that PIPE-791 effectively reduces fibrosis and fibrotic markers in vitro and in vivo and that it has slow association and dissociation kinetics. Taken together, our data support clinical testing of PIPE-791 in the context of fibrotic conditions such as IPF."
"Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a chronic lung disease characterized by progressive scarring of lung tissue, which can lead to respiratory failure and other serious complications, making the search for safe and effective therapeutic agents an urgent priority; Maimendong Decoction (MMDD), a traditional Chinese herbal formula widely employed in clinical practice to treat pulmonary disorders, has been shown to reduce inflammatory cytokines, suppress pro-fibrotic factors, and alleviate oxidative stress, yet the precise mechanisms by which MMDD exerts its anti-fibrotic effects remain unclear. This study aims to evaluate the therapeutic efficacy of MMDD in pulmonary fibrosis and to elucidate its underlying mechanisms. Using a bleomycin (BLM)-induced mouse model of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, we assessed the therapeutic impact of MMDD on pulmonary fibrosis; concurrently, Ophiopogonin-D (OP-D), a principal active ingredient of MMDD, was evaluated in an in vitro human fetal lung fibroblast model treated with transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) to elucidate its precise anti-fibrotic mechanism; finally, multi-omics technologies and bioinformatics analyses were employed for comprehensive validation. MMDD ameliorated the degeneration observed in BLM-induced pulmonary fibrosis by curbing fibroblast activation and the over-deposition of extracellular matrix. Comprehensive multi-omics and bioinformatics analyses further indicated that MMDD modulates fibroblast behaviors-including proliferation and ferroptosis-through inhibition of the TGF-β signaling pathway. In vitro studies showed that OP-D induces ferroptosis in TGF-β-treated lung fibroblasts by blocking the negative regulatory signals of ferroptosis, mainly via downregulation of Ferritin Heavy Chain 1 (FTH1) expression. Moreover, overexpressing FTH1 nullified the anti-fibrotic activity of OP-D. The results of this study indicate that MMDD and its active component, OP-D, can treat IPF by targeting the proliferation of lung fibroblasts."
"Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a progressive interstitial lung disease of unknown etiology with poor prognosis and limited therapies. OTS514, a PBK inhibitor, has been implicated in suppressing tumor progression by modulating various cellular biological processes. Nonetheless, the potential impact of PBK and OTS514 on IPF have yet to be elucidated. PBK expression and distribution in IPF and control lung tissues were analyzed by Western blot, RT-PCR, and immunofluorescence. Then, the bleomycin (BLM) -induced mouse model and human precision-cut lung slices (HPCLS) were utilized to detect the antifibrotic effects of the OTS514. Primary lung fibroblasts derived from both control and IPF patients were further employed to uncover the underlying mechanisms of PBK. Our study demonstrated that PBK expression was markedly elevated in IPF patients and exhibited a negative correlation with lung function. Remarkably, the administration of OTS514 significantly mitigated collagen deposition and lung tissue remodeling in the BLM-induced mouse model. Additionally, OTS514 also exserted a pronounced antifibrotic effect in HPCLS, as evident by downregulation of fibrotic related markers expression (α-SMA, Collagen 1 and Fibronectin) and pathological manifestations. In vitro experiments demonstrated that the inhibition of PBK suppressed fibroblast differentiation and migratory capacity, reduced the proliferation rate, and promoted apoptosis. Mechanically, we discovered that the protective effect of OTS514 in vivo and vitro was closely dependent upon the endoplasmic reticulum stress pathways. Collectively, our data underscores the potential of OTS514 as an antifibrotic strategy by attenuating fibroblast-to-myofibroblast transition. Furthermore, the administration of OTS514 manifested no adverse effects in mouse model."
"Cellular senescence and the formation of fibrotic scarring are critical in the progression of chronic illnesses, such as pulmonary fibrosis (PF). In this context, the transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-β) pathway represents a central driver in orchestrating the pathological cascade. TGF-β governs cellular activities such as differentiation, apoptosis, and extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling as a pleiotropic cytokine. In the lungs, dysregulated TGF-β signaling leads to cellular senescence and release of pro-inflammatory mediators, constituting the senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP). This reinforces a microenvironment conducive to fibroblast activation, prolonged myofibroblast retention, and accelerated aberrant ECM deposition, culminating in progressive tissue fibrosis. For instance, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is marked by the buildup of senescent alveolar epithelial cells (AECs) that impair regular tissue repair and alter the microenvironment to promote fibrogenesis. TGF-β signaling is activated through SMAD-dependent (canonical) and SMAD-independent (non-canonical) pathways, each contributing to the persistence of activated fibroblasts, aberrant ECM accumulation, and irreversible tissue remodeling. The interdependence between senescence and TGF-β signaling perpetuates fibrotic injury and enhances susceptibility to future fibrotic insults. This review delves into understanding the molecular convergence of TGF-β signaling and cellular senescence in PF, highlighting key biomarkers and emerging therapeutic strategies. While several clinical trials evaluating TGF-β antagonists, small molecules, and cell-based therapies show considerable promise, challenges remain regarding their successful translation into effective, targeted treatments. Nevertheless, continued exploration of TGF-β's multifaceted role in fibrosis and senescence offers hope for developing innovative therapies for PF and other chronic fibrotic diseases."
"Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) exhibits notable sex-based disparities and male patients with IPF are significantly more numerous than female patients. Therefore, the female patients are often overlooked and under-investigated. This study aimed to evaluate the clinical characteristics and all-cause mortality in female patients with IPF in Chinese population. This retrospective cohort study included IPF patients registered at Xiangya Hospital of Central South University and the First Affiliated People's Hospital of Shaoyang University from January 2015 to May 2024. The data on age, sex, body mass index, smoking (pack-years), forced expiratory volume in one second to forced vital capacity, diffusing capacity of the lung for carbon monoxide percentage of predicted (DL<sub>CO</sub> %pred), diffusing capacity divided by the alveolar volume (DL<sub>CO</sub>/VA), laboratory analysis, comorbidities, and antifibrotic therapy were collected. The patients were followed-up to collect the data on all-cause mortality. A total of 583 patients were enrolled and 116 (19.9%) of them were female. Female patients had higher levels of forced expiratory volume in one second to forced vital capacity, DL<sub>CO</sub> %pred, DL<sub>CO</sub>/VA, arterial oxygen partial pressure (Pao<sub>2</sub>), and total cholesterol, while a lower smoking (pack-years), haemoglobin, blood urea, uric acid, myoglobin, and creatine kinase. The proportion of lung cancer and antifibrotic therapy were lower in female patients (P < 0.05). Logistic regression analysis showed that haemoglobin (odds ratio (OR) = 0.813; 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.706-0.937) and blood urea (OR = 0.158; 95% CI = 0.030-0.849) as negatively associated with female, while total cholesterol (OR = 14.699; 95% CI = 1.892-114.190) and DL<sub>CO</sub> %pred (OR = 1.112; 95% CI = 1.005-1.229) were positively associated (P < 0.05). Over a median follow-up period of 31.0 (12.0-64.0) months, a total of 489 patients with IPF were analysed the all-cause mortality and 101 (20.7%) of them were female. Cox regression analysis revealed that female patients had significantly lower all-cause mortality compared to males (hazard ratio = 0.168; 95% CI = 0.031-0.920, P < 0.05). Significant differences in clinical characteristics and prognosis were observed between male and female IPF patients in Chinese population. Specifically, female patients exhibited better pulmonary function, higher Pao<sub>2</sub>, and lower all-cause mortality than male patients. Therefore, gender differences should be systematically evaluated in the diagnostic and therapeutic approach to IPF, and targeted strategies should be developed to optimise treatment outcomes in female patients."
"Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a chronic and progressive interstitial lung disease associated with high morbidity and mortality. Both pulmonary and extrapulmonary comorbidities significantly influence disease progression and patient outcomes. Despite current therapeutic options, effective treatments remain limited. Quercetin, a naturally occurring flavonoid, has emerged as a promising compound due to its antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and antifibrotic properties. Preclinical and clinical studies have demonstrated its ability to modulate key molecular pathways involved in IPF, including Nrf2, SIRT1/AMPK, and the regulation of fibrosis-associated microRNAs (miRNAs). Furthermore, quercetin shows therapeutic potential across a range of IPF-related comorbidities, including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, pulmonary hypertension, lung cancer, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and psychiatric disorders. Under these conditions, quercetin acts via epigenetic modulation of miRNAs and regulation of oxidative stress and inflammatory signaling pathways. This review highlights the multifunctional role of quercetin in IPF and its comorbidities, emphasizing its gene regulatory mechanisms and potential as an adjunctive or alternative therapeutic strategy."
"<b>Objectives</b>: COVID-19, caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, has infected over 777 million individuals and led to approximately 7 million deaths worldwide. Despite significant efforts to develop effective therapies, treatment remains largely supportive, especially for severe complications like acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Numerous compounds from diverse pharmacological classes are currently undergoing preclinical and clinical evaluation, targeting both the virus and the host immune response. <b>Methods</b>: Despite the large number of articles published and after a preliminary attempt was published, we discarded the option of a systematic review. Instead, we have done a description of therapies with these results and a tentative mechanism of action. <b>Results</b>: Preliminary studies and early-phase clinical trials have demonstrated the potential of Mesenchymal Stem Cells (MSCs) in mitigating severe lung damage in COVID-19 patients. Previous research has shown MSCs to be effective in treating various pulmonary conditions, including acute lung injury, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, ARDS, asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and lung cancer. Their ability to reduce inflammation and promote tissue repair supports their potential role in managing COVID-19-related complications. This review demonstrates the utility of MSCs in the acute phase of COVID-19 and postulates the etiopathogenic role of mitochondria in Long-COVID. Even more, their combination with other therapies is also analyzed. <b>Conclusions</b>: While the therapeutic application of MSCs in COVID-19 is still in early stages, emerging evidence suggests promising outcomes. As research advances, MSCs may become an integral part of treatment strategies for severe COVID-19, particularly in addressing immune-related lung injury and promoting recovery. However, a full pathogenic mechanism may explain or unify the complexity of signs and symptoms of Long COVID and Post-Acute Sequelae (PASC)."
"Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is characterized by excessive extracellular matrix (ECM) deposition driven by aberrant fibroblast-to-myofibroblast transition (FMT). However, the upstream regulators and downstream effectors of this process remain incompletely understood. Here, we identify acyl-CoA synthetase long-chain family member 4 (ACSL4), a lipid metabolic enzyme, as a critical mediator linking complement component 5a (C5a)/C5a receptor 1 (C5aR1) signaling to FMT via calcium signaling. In bleomycin (BLM)-induced pulmonary fibrosis of C57BL/6JGpt mice, and in C5a-stimulated primary lung fibroblasts, the expression of ACSL4 was markedly upregulated. Pharmacological inhibition of ACSL4 (PRGL493) or C5aR1 (PMX53) attenuated the deposition of ECM and suppressed the expression of fibrotic markers in vivo and in vitro. Mechanistically, the activation of C5a/C5aR1 signaling increased intracellular calcium levels and promoted the expression of ACSL4, while inhibition of calcium signaling (FK506) reversed the upregulation of ACSL4 and FMT-related changes, including the expression of α-smooth muscle actin (αSMA) and the migration of fibroblasts. Notably, inhibition of ACSL4 did not affect the proliferation of fibroblasts, suggesting its specific role in phenotypic transition. These findings demonstrate that ACSL4 functions downstream of C5a/C5aR1-induced calcium signaling to promote FMT and the progression of pulmonary fibrosis. Targeting ACSL4 may therefore offer a novel therapeutic strategy for IPF."
"Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a progressive disease often complicated by pulmonary hypertension (PH), leading to a worse prognosis. In this study, we use the term “secondary PH” to refer to PH that develops as a complication of IPF (i.e., IPF-PH), and “the ERPE (Exercise-Responsive PAP Elevation) group, defined as patients without resting PH but with potential PAP elevation during exertion, indicating early pulmonary vascular stress.” This study aimed to evaluate the impact of pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) on the clinical course, activities of daily living (ADL), and exercise tolerance in IPF patients. Additionally, we sought to determine whether PVR influences prognosis within a short-term period of just two years. This exploratory single-center study was conducted as an interim analysis of a prospective trial targeting patients with IPF complicated by secondary PH or ERPE. The analysis included 49 IPF patients who received conventional IPF management without pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH)-specific therapies and completed a two-year follow-up. Pulmonary circulation parameters, including PVR and pulmonary artery pressure (PAP), were assessed via right heart catheterization. Lung function, ADL, and exercise tolerance were also evaluated. Statistical analyses were performed to assess the association between PVR and prognosis. Higher PVR was significantly associated with poorer prognosis and worsening restrictive lung impairment. PVR correlated with modified Medical Research Council (mMRC) scores (Spearman’s ρ = 0.47, <i>p</i> = 0.0007) and 6-minute walk distance (Spearman’s ρ = -0.41, <i>p</i> = 0.0042). Proportional hazard analysis identified PVR as a significant predictor of overall survival (hazard ratio [HR]: 1.28, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.0055–1.53, <i>p</i> = 0.013). PVR also strongly correlated with maximum exercise tolerance (Spearman’s ρ = -0.60, <i>p</i> < 0.0001). Importantly, even within the short two-year follow-up, elevated PVR significantly impacted both home-stay survival (HR: 1.20, 95% CI: 1.0072–1.41, <i>p</i> = 0.032) and overall survival, underscoring its predictive value over a short time frame. PVR is associated with prognosis, ADL, and exercise tolerance in IPF patients. Importantly, even within a short two-year period, PVR was significantly linked to clinical outcomes. While causality cannot be established, our findings suggest that PVR <i>may serve as a potentially useful early prognostic marker</i>. Regular PVR monitoring could provide valuable insights into disease progression and may support earlier therapeutic interventions to improve outcomes. This study is registered in the UMIN Clinical Trials Registry (UMIN000055468). Trial registration at 10/09/2024. Retrospectively registered.

"Polyethylene terephthalate microplastics (PET-MPs) are persistent in the environment and have become an emerging health concern. PET-MPs play a role in lung pathologies; however, little is known about their role in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). Our research aimed to determine the role of PET-MPs in exacerbating IPF by combining improved detection and toxicology. The ProTox 3.0 platform was used to predict the microplastic toxicity of polyethylene terephthalate. The toxicological mechanism of PET-MP-induced IPF was explored using network toxicology, molecular docking, Mendelian randomization, and single-cell sequencing analysis. By analyzing the PubChem, ChEMBL, and SwissTargetPrediction databases, 120 potential targets related to PET-MPs exposure were identified, and 81 intersecting targets were obtained by intersecting the IPF gene in the Gene Expression Omnibus database. These were further optimized into three core targets, namely AKT1, PIM1, and PIK3CD. PET-MPs affected metabolic, lipid, atherosclerosis, and C-type selection receptor signaling pathways. The binding affinity of PET-MPs to these core targets was potent, and PET-MPs had a good binding effect with these target proteins. PET-MPs exhibit lung toxicity, which may be related to three key proteins: AKT1, PIK3CD, and PIM1. PET-MPs may exacerbate IPF via metabolic pathways, lipids, and atherosclerosis, which may occur in AT2 and CD8<sup>+</sup>T cells. This study offers valuable information on the molecular mechanism of IPF triggered by PET-MPs, emphasizing the practicality of network toxicology in the toxicity evaluation of emerging environmental contaminants."
"Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a disease of progressive lung remodeling and collagen deposition that leads to respiratory failure. Myeloid cells are abundant in IPF lung and in murine lung fibrosis, but their functional effects are incompletely understood. Using mouse and human lung models, we show that ornithine produced by myeloid cells expressing Arginase 1 (ARG1) serves as a substrate for proline and collagen synthesis by lung fibroblasts. The predominant ARG1-expressing myeloid cells in mouse lung were macrophages, but in IPF lung, high-dimensional imaging revealed ARG1 to be expressed mainly in neutrophils. Small-molecule ARG1 inhibition suppressed both ornithine levels and collagen expression in cultured, precision-cut IPF lung slices and in murine lung fibrosis. These results were confirmed in macrophage-specific Arg1 KO mice. Furthermore, we find that this pathway is regulated by cell-to-cell crosstalk, starting with purinergic signaling: Extracellular ATP (eATP) receptor P2RX4 was necessary for fibroblast IL-6 expression, which in turn was necessary for ARG1 expression by myeloid cells. Taken together, our findings define an immune-mesenchymal circuit that governs profibrotic metabolism in lung fibrosis."
"Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a kind of interstitial lung disease with a poor prognosis. Even though genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified numerous loci linked to IPF risk, the underlying causal genes and biological processes are still mostly unknown. The IPF GWAS summary data included 4,125 cases, 20,464 controls from five cohorts. The weight file and related files for transcriptome association studies (TWAS) of plasma protein, multi-tissues, cross-tissue, and single-cell were obtained from Zhang's study, Mancuso lab, GTExV8 database, and Thompson's study, respectively. We conducted TWAS employing functional Summary-based Imputation (FUSION) from four levels, which were plasma protein, multiple tissues, cross-tissue, and single cell. Conditional and joint (COJO) analysis and multi-marker analysis of genomic annotation (MAGMA) analysis were used to validate the above results. Summary-data-based Mendelian randomization (SMR) and Bayesian co-localization analysis were utilized to explain the causal association between selected genes and the risk of IPF. A total of 12, 361, 1187, and 72 genes were calculated from the four dimensions of TWAS. TOLLIP, GCHFR, ZNF318 TALDO1, CD151, and AP4M1 were selected by intersecting the results of the four sets of genes. GCHFR, TALDO1, CD151, and AP4M1 were verified by COJO analysis and MAGMA analysis. SMR and colocalization analyses identified GCHFR as the most significant gene for IPF. We have applied the TWAS approach to identify novel therapeutic targets for IPF in multiple dimensions. Further biological testing will be required in future studies to validate our findings. In summary, we carried out an extensive TWAS that integrated four dimensions: plasma protein, multiple tissues, cross-tissue, and single cell. GCHFR was identified as the most significant gene for IPF in this study."
"Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a chronic and progressive interstitial lung disease (ILD) with poor prognosis and limited therapeutic options. The introduction of antifibrotic agents has improved survival outcomes in IPF patients, which has led to more frequent recognition of comorbidities, particularly lung cancer (LC). This review summarizes current evidence on the epidemiology and pathogenesis of LC in the context of IPF, with particular emphasis placed on shared molecular, cellular, genetic, and epigenetic alterations. Diagnostic approaches and available treatment modalities, including surgical, systemic, and radiation therapies, are outlined, and their limitations in patients with IPF-LC are discussed. Acute exacerbations (AEs), as a life-threatening complication influencing diagnostic and treatment strategies, are specifically addressed. Moreover, studies indicating a possible protective effect of antifibrotic agents against LC development in IPF are reviewed. Further research is warranted into the shared mechanisms of IPF and LC to identify novel therapeutic targets. Establishing standardized, multidisciplinary clinical guidelines is essential for optimizing patient management, reducing AE risk, and improving patient outcomes."
"Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a progressive and life-threatening interstitial lung disease characterized by excessive extracellular matrix deposition and fibroblast activation. Emerging evidence suggests that amino acid metabolism plays a crucial role in the pathogenesis of pulmonary fibrosis. Key amino acids, including arginine, proline, and glutamine, contribute to the regulation of fibroblast activity and collagen synthesis, all of which are essential for fibrotic progression. Studies in experimental models of pulmonary fibrosis have demonstrated significant metabolic dysregulation, further highlighting its relevance in disease development. Moreover, targeting amino acid metabolism has emerged as a promising therapeutic strategy, with novel drugs and interventions designed to modulate metabolic pathways showing potential in preclinical and clinical studies. This review explores the intricate interplay between amino acid metabolism and pulmonary fibrosis, discusses its implications for disease progression, and evaluates the therapeutic prospects of metabolic interventions in IPF management. Understanding these metabolic mechanisms may pave the way for more effective and personalized treatment strategies for IPF."
"This research aims to detect genes associated with the extracellular matrix (ECM) in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) using bioinformatics techniques and investigate their relationships with immune infiltration, with the goal of identifying new diagnostic and therapeutic targets for IPF. The study employed a combination of differential expression analysis, weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA), and various machine learning algorithms to screen for characteristic genes. Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA), gene ontology (GO), and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) were utilized to evaluate relevant biological functions and pathways. Additionally, the analysis of immune cell infiltration was conducted to assess the disease's immune status and the correlations between genes and immunity. IPF is strongly linked to pathways such as ECM organization and immune response, with differentially expressed genes primarily involving signal pathways related to collagen deposition in the extracellular matrix. A total of 1,193 ECM-related genes associated with IPF were identified, and 94 differentially expressed ECM-related genes were further screened compared to the normal control group. Through machine learning approaches, three key genes-BAAT, COMP, and CXCL13-were pinpointed. These genes are closely tied to the onset, progression, and immune processes of IPF, and clustering analysis based on them can reveal distinct disease states and changes in immune cell infiltration patterns. BAAT, COMP, and CXCL13 may serve as potential therapeutic targets for slowing the progression and preventing the exacerbation of IPF. Moreover, monocytes demonstrate consistent infiltration patterns across the disease group, control group, and various subgroups, indicating their potential significance in the development of IPF."
"The gut microbiota constitutes a vital ecosystem within the human body playing a pivotal role in immune regulation and metabolic homeostasis. Emerging research underscores a sophisticated interplay between the gut and lungs, termed the ""gut-lung axis."" Gut microbes exert influence over pulmonary immunity and metabolism via immune mediators (e.g., cytokines and interleukins), metabolites (e.g., short-chain fatty acids) and direct microbial translocation. Dysbiosis of the gut microbiota has been implicated in a spectrum of respiratory diseases, including asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), acute lung injury (ALI), Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), lung cancer, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH), acute lower respiratory infection (ALRI) and tuberculosis (TB). Although multi-omics technologies have elucidated certain mechanisms underlying the gut-lung axis, numerous pathways remain to be fully delineated. This review synthesizes current knowledge on the role of gut microbiota and their metabolites in respiratory diseases and assesses their therapeutic potential. Future investigations should prioritize strategies to restore and maintain microbial homeostasis, such as dietary modifications, probiotic supplementation and fecal microbiota transplantation to pioneer novel preventive and therapeutic approaches. These summaries of advances in gut microbiology research promise better management and exploration of therapeutic strategies for respiratory diseases."
"Pulmonary fibrosis (PF) is the leading cause of death in many lung diseases due to inflammation, tissue damage, infection, or other contributing factors. Iron metabolism and ferroptosis have been reported to participate in some PF diseases, but the universality remains elusive. Herein, comparative studies were conducted among idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), immune-associated systemic sclerosis (SSc), and infectious COVID-19. The iron level was evaluated by Perls' staining and ferritin level. Ferroptosis was detected by immunohistochemistry (malondialdehyde, oxidizing lipids, GPX4, and FSP1) and transmission electron microscopy. The results were also validated by public datasets analysis. Furthermore, the iron homeostasis and ferroptosis signatures were studied in the SARS-Cov-2 spike protein-induced PF cell model. The iron-mediated inflammation and fibrosis in PF were evaluated both in vitro and in vivo. We found that COVID-19 patients showed the most severe pulmonary damage and fibrosis signature. COVID-19 and SSc-PF patients have more obvious immune cell infiltration with CD11c<sup>+</sup> monocytes and CD68 <sup>+</sup> macrophages. Iron overload and ferroptosis were common in PF, while COVID-19 patients showed distinct iron metabolism signatures with higher expression of HO-1. Among all ferroptosis markers, IPF patients showed the highest E06 level, COVID-19 and SSc-PF had both higher levels of MDA and 4HNE. Further studies showed iron overload and ferroptosis occurred mainly in alveolar type II cells and macrophages. Deferoxamine (DFO) and Ferrostatin-1 (Fer1) effectively prevented malondialdehyde production and IL-6 upregulation. DFO and Fer1 alleviated fibrosis in mice. Our study demonstrates that iron overload and ferroptosis are common signatures in PF and represent potential therapeutic targets."
"Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is an interstitial fibrotic lung disease characterized by myofibroblast differentiation and collagen deposition. Excessive activation of fibroblasts in the lungs leads to severe alveolar dysfunction and tissue destruction seen by histological assessment. IPF presents a high mortality rate, limited therapeutic options, and an intense need to develop safe and effective therapeutic drugs. Lysionotin is a flavonoid isolated from herbal extracts with various biological effects such as anti-tuberculosis mycobacteria and anti-inflammatory. Nevertheless, its effect on pulmonary fibrosis is not known. This study aims to investigate the effect of Lysionotin on bleomycin (BLM)-induced pulmonary fibrosis and its mechanism. We used BLM to establish a mouse model of pulmonary fibrosis and injected Lysionotin intraperitoneally on days 15-28 to observe its effect on pulmonary fibrosis. The molecular mechanism of Lysionotin was investigated in vitro using transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) induced myofibroblasts. Lysionotin attenuates TGF-β-induced myofibroblast differentiation and oxidative stress by promoting nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) and its downstream expression of antioxidant genes NAD(P)H quinone dehydrogenase 1 (NQO-1) and heme oxygenase 1 (HO-1) by activating AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK). Lysionotin exerts anti-pulmonary fibrosis effects by regulating myofibroblast differentiation and reducing oxidative stress through the AMPK/Nrf2 pathway, illustrating the potential significance of Lysionotin in protecting against BLM-induced pulmonary fibrosis."
"Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a rare and fatal lung disease caused by progressive damage to alveolar epithelial cells, leading to abnormal activation of mesenchymal cells. The PRRX1 transcription factor (TF) has been found to be reactivated in IPF and was previously identified as a key mesenchymal TF in pulmonary fibrosis. In this study, we utilized the Prrx1:CreERT2; Rosa26iTomato murine transgenic line to further characterize the Prrx1-positive cell lineage in healthy and fibrotic lungs. The Prrx1 limb enhancer (Prrx1enh) was undetectable by immunohistochemistry in uninjured lung tissue. However, during the fibrotic phase in the bleomycin model of pulmonary fibrosis, Prrx1enh became activated, marking a population of cells that differentiated into mesenchymal progeny. To investigate further, we conducted reprogramming of these subpopulations after conditional and inducible Prrx1 loss of function. Prrx1 loss in these cells led to worsened fibrosis, indicating that this specific cell population has antifibrotic properties. Our findings reveal a previously unrecognized subpopulation of Prrx1-positive mesenchymal cells that are activated during fibrogenesis. These cells could serve as targets for future therapies aimed at mitigating fibrotic progression in IPF."
"The widespread distribution of air pollutants poses a major challenge to global public health, causing a range of health problems, including the incidence and progression of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). This study aims to provide insights into the specific effects of air pollutants on the risk of IPF through a systematic evaluation and meta-analysis approach. The present study was conducted through a comprehensive search of four data-Embase, Web of Science, PubMed, and Cochrane Library-from their inception to 25th November 2024, limited to English-language literature. To assess the potential relationship between a wide range of air pollutants and IPF, a random effects model was used to estimate the risk factors in this study. In addition, subgroup analyses of the data according to age, sex, smoking habits, and geographic location were performed, with the aim of exploring the relationship between air pollutants and the risk of IPF in different populations. A total of 17 papers covering 14 countries were included in this study, totaling 18 studies involving 858,557 participants and 25,968 event occurrences. Our systematic evaluation and meta-analysis showed an increased risk of IPF disease progression for every 5 µg/m<sup>3</sup> increase in PM<sub>2.5</sub> (RR = 1.08, 95% CI:1.01,1.15; I<sup>2</sup> = 63.51%; p = 0.01; 7 studies). The risk of IPF progression was increased for every 10 µg/m<sup>3</sup> increase in NO<sub>2</sub> ( RR = 1.32,95% CI:1.16,1.50; I<sup>2</sup> = 38.59%; p = 0.12; 7 studies). For every 10 µg/m<sup>3</sup> increase in O<sub>3</sub>, there was an increased risk of IPF progression (RR = 1.19, 95% CI:1.03,1.38; I<sup>2</sup> = 29.05%; p = 0.24; 4 studies). For every 10 µg/m<sup>3</sup> increase in CO increase of 10 µg/m<sup>3</sup> was associated with an increased risk of IPF progression (RR = 1.28, 95% CI:1.01,1.63; I<sup>2</sup> = 20.03%; p = 0.29; 3 studies). For every 10 µg/m<sup>3</sup> increase in NO<sub>X</sub>, the risk of IPF progression was increased (RR = 1.21, 95% CI:1.11, 1.33; I<sup>2</sup> = 13.69%; p = 0.31; 3 studies). For every 10 µg/m<sup>3</sup> increase in NO<sub>2</sub>, there was an increased risk of IPF incidence (RR = 1.67, 95% CI:1.05,2.66; I<sup>2</sup> = 36.94%; p = 0.20; 3 studies). This study found that NO<sub>2</sub> and PM<sub>2.5</sub> increase the risk of IPF disease progression, while NO<sub>X</sub>, CO, and O<sub>3</sub> also increase this risk, albeit with limited data. In addition, NO<sub>2</sub> increases the risk of IPF occurrence. Therefore, global health policies targeting reductions in air pollutants like NO<sub>2</sub> and PM<sub>2.5</sub> may reduce the risk of the occurrence and progression of IPF, with significant implications for the future prevention and treatment of IPF."
"Smoking could potentiate the profibrotic effects of silica in the lungs, including increasing the risk of cancer and silicosis. Crystalline silica-induced silicosis has been associated with lung fibrosis. Moreover, smoking is strongly linked with an increased risk of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. Although pulmonary fibrosis is a recognized feature in asthma airway modeling, the effects of cigarette smoke and silica, both individually and together, have not been studied. We examined the effect of cigarette smoke extract (CSE) on silica-induced fibrosis in asthmatic patients and healthy individuals by using fibroblasts from both groups. Cigarette smoke enhanced the fibrotic effects of silica in healthy and asthmatic lung fibroblasts. Healthy fibroblasts exhibited low baseline levels of fibrotic proteins. However, exposure to CSE and silica significantly increased extracellular matrix (ECM) markers. Asthmatic fibroblasts, with higher baseline levels of these markers, showed even greater upregulation upon exposure. The combination of silica and cigarette smoke also promoted collagen deposition and upregulated levels of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and their inhibitors (TIMP-1 and TIMP-2) in asthmatic fibroblasts. Cessation of smoking and control of silica exposure are essential for reducing lung inflammation and fibrosis. Additionally, therapeutic targets should be investigated for their protective effects against these toxins."
"Pirfenidone (PFD) is a pyridine-like compound most well-known for its use in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). However, its broad anti-inflammatory and anti-fibrotic actions make PFD a candidate for other scarring diseases. This review examines the use of PFD for dermatologic conditions. The literature supports the potential for PFD to decrease scarring in a variety of skin conditions. Both oral and topical preparations have been shown to be effective at aiding skin healing. Early clinical evidence demonstrates significant improvements in hypertrophic burn scars, reduction in fibrosis in localized scleroderma, and accelerated epithelialization of skin graft donor sites. These clinical outcomes are supported by PFD's modulation of the transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-β) pathway, which plays a central role in skin fibrosis and scarring. Evidence in this review suggests topical PFD can be used to fill a clinical need for local anti-fibrotic therapies."
"Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis and progressive pulmonary fibrosis are advanced interstitial lung diseases with high morbidity and mortality, particularly during and following acute exacerbations. Intensive care unit admissions are often due to respiratory failure, with limited treatment options. Advanced life support measures, such as mechanical ventilation and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, should be considered only as bridges to lung transplantation. The integration of palliative care and ongoing discussions about goals of care with patients and their families remain essential in managing these complex cases."
"Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a progressive and often fatal lung disease. Despite recent treatment advancements, survival rates for IPF patients remain low, reflecting the urgent need for a deeper understanding of disease mechanisms. A key feature of IPF progression is the excessive growth of fibroblasts and their transformation into myofibroblasts, driven by a profibrotic feedforward loop involving mediators like transforming growth factor (TGF) α and β1. These factors activate the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and TGFβ1 receptor (TGFβR1), perpetuating fibrosis. MicroRNAs play a vital role in regulating gene expression, and many are disrupted in IPF. Through RNA sequencing and quantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction, we identified miR-146b as one of the most significantly reduced miRNAs in human lung fibroblasts (HLF) following TGFβ1 treatment, with a confirmed 70% decrease in expression. Although miR-146b is normally abundant in lung fibroblasts, its levels are significantly lower in lung fibroblasts from IPF patients (HLF-F) and in mice with experimental pulmonary fibrosis. HLF-F exhibited greater responses to profibrotic signals compared with nonfibrotic fibroblasts. Elevating miR-146b levels in HLF-F reduced TGFα-induced proliferation and inhibited TGFβ1-induced myofibroblast differentiation by 60%-90%. Conversely, deletion of the miR-146b gene enhanced fibrotic responses in mouse lung fibroblasts. Additionally, miR-146b directly targets critical signaling pathways, including EGFR, Jun, TGFβR1, and SMAD3, thereby suppressing fibroblast proliferative and fibrogenic activities. Thus, targeting miR-146b presents a promising therapeutic strategy to inhibit lung fibroblast proliferation and differentiation by modulating the profibrotic feedforward loop of EGFR and TGFβR signaling pathways. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: Excess fibroblast proliferation and differentiation into myofibroblasts in response to profibrotic mediators are considered key steps in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis progression. This study identified miR-146b as an important endogenous antifibrotic factor via inhibition of both lung fibroblast proliferation and differentiation. The repression of miR-146b by transforming growth factor β1 also uncovers a new mechanism linking the factors that drive fibrosis and excessive cell growth in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, opening up new avenues for slowing disease progression and improving patient outcomes via restoration of miR-146b expression."
"Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a progressive lung disease with limited treatment options. This study investigates the therapeutic potential of resveratrol, a natural compound, in treating IPF by targeting IKZF3, a transcription factor upregulated in IPF patients. Using bioinformatics analysis of the GSE110147 dataset, we identified IKZF3 as a key molecule in IPF progression. In vitro experiments with bleomycin (BLM)-treated A549 cells showed that IKZF3 overexpression exacerbated cell death and fibrosis, while its silencing reversed these effects. Resveratrol treatment significantly improved cell viability, reduced fibrosis markers, and inhibited IKZF3's transcriptional regulation of IL-33, which in turn decreased ILC-2 activation. Molecular docking revealed a strong binding affinity between resveratrol and IKZF3. In vivo validation using a BLM-induced IPF mouse model demonstrated that resveratrol reduced lung fibrosis and downregulated fibrosis-related markers. Our findings suggest that targeting IKZF3 with resveratrol may offer a novel therapeutic strategy for IPF, highlighting the potential of this combination to improve disease outcomes."
"Whether the long-term survival of patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is worse than that of patients with IPF combined with emphysema after anti-fibrotic therapy is unclear. This study aimed to compare treatment outcomes between the two groups and identify potential predictors of mortality. This retrospective cohort study was conducted in seven hospitals across Taiwan between August 2015 and August 2022 and included patients with IPF who received anti-fibrotic agents covered by national insurance. Based on the extent of emphysema observed on high-resolution chest tomography, patients with IPF were categorized into two groups: IPF only; and IPF with emphysema. Baseline characteristics and survival outcomes were compared between the groups. Cox proportional hazards models were used for multivariable analysis to identify factors associated with overall mortality during the follow-up period. Of the 275 patients included, 126 (45.8%) had IPF with emphysema and 149 (54.2%) had IPF only. The emphysema group had a higher proportion of males and patients with a smoking history, finger clubbing, comorbidities, or a definite usual interstitial pneumonia (UIP) pattern compared to the IPF-only group. Additionally, this group had a higher forced vital capacity (FVC, %) and forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV₁, L), while FEV₁ (%) was similar and FEV₁/FVC (%) was lower. During a median follow-up of 3.7 years, the overall survival rates were comparable (IPF only: 45.6%; IPF with emphysema: 48.4%). The overall survival of patients with probable UIP was significantly better than that of patients with definite UIP (53.5% vs. 34.6%). Likewise, the survival rate of the group with a diffusing capacity of the lung for carbon monoxide (DLCO) > 49% was higher than that of the group with DLCO ≤ 49% (53.9% vs. 31.4%). After adjusting for confounders, lower body mass index (BMI) (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR] = 0.95) and comorbid pulmonary hypertension (aHR = 2.27) were independently associated with increased overall mortality. Neither the presence of emphysema nor the type of anti-fibrotic agent was associated with mortality. The survival outcomes of patients with IPF and emphysema and those of patients with IPF only are comparable after treatment with anti-fibrotic agents. Lower BMI and comorbid pulmonary hypertension are significant predictors of increased mortality."
"Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a chronic, progressive, and fatal lung disease with limited treatment options. Our preliminary research identified phosphodiesterase 1 (PDE1) as a potential therapeutic target for IPF treatment. However, both the molecular recognition mechanism between PDE1 inhibitors and the protein, as well as the antifibrotic mechanism, remain incompletely understood. In this study, structural modifications were carried out on a pan-PDE inhibitor <b>1</b> we previously developed. The lead compound <b>4b</b> exhibited an IC<sub>50</sub> of 5 nM against PDE1, excellent selectivity across PDE subfamilies and favorable safety properties. Structure-activity relationship analysis combined with binding mode predictions demonstrated that targeting differential residues in the H-loop regions of PDEs is critical for improving selectivity over other PDEs. Furthermore, we demonstrated that the PDE1 inhibitor attenuated pulmonary fibrosis by suppressing both the TGF-β/Smad and MAPK pathways."
"Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a progressive lung disease marked by excessive fibrous tissue accumulation in the lung interstitium, leading to a gradual deterioration of respiratory function and significantly impairing patients' quality of life. Despite advances in understanding its etiology and pathogenesis, the exact mechanisms remain unclear, underscoring the need for novel biomarkers and therapeutic targets. We analyzed five publicly available datasets from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO), specifically ""GSE15197,"" ""GSE53845,"" ""GSE135065,"" ""GSE185691,"" and ""GSE195770,"" to identify gene expression changes associated with IPF. Data were annotated and normalized to minimize batch effects and technical variability. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) verified preprocessing efficacy. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified using linear modeling. Core DEGs were selected via integrative analysis across datasets. Our analysis revealed DEGs that are substantially linked to crucial biological processes such as extracellular matrix organization and immune response regulation. Integrative analysis of five GEO datasets identified CXCL14, MMP7, and MDK as core differentially expressed genes in the final predictive model. Using Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) regression and Random Forest, we constructed a logistic regression model with robust predictive performance, achieving an AUC of 0.92 in the training cohort and 0.89 in the validation cohort, with sensitivity of 88% and specificity of 85%. The Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP) method identified CXCL14 (mean SHAP value = 0.38) as the most influential feature, followed by MMP7 and MDK. Functional enrichment analyses highlighted significant enrichment of TGF-<i>β</i> signaling, extracellular matrix organization, and chemokine signaling pathways. Immune infiltration analysis revealed positive correlations between CXCL14 expression and alveolar macrophage/activated fibroblast populations, while SHAP interaction analysis identified synergistic effects between CXCL14 and TGF-β1 in driving fibrosis. These findings substantiate the hypothesis that IPF pathogenesis is closely linked to extracellular matrix remodeling and immune dysregulation. This suggests that future investigations should delve deeper into the practical applications of identified biomarkers in the early diagnosis and management of IPF. Furthermore, the machine learning-based predictive model demonstrates strong clinical potential and merits further validation in prospective trials to assess its utility and therapeutic implications in real-world settings."
"Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), a lethal respiratory disease with few treatment options, occurs due to an excessive process of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and abnormal accumulation of extracellular matrix (ECM), eventually leading to fibrotic scarring and destruction of alveolar structures. Here, a bioinspired inhalable nanocomplex (CCMφ@PTNPs) is reported for inhibiting the EMT progress and clearing the intrapulmonary ECM, thereby reversing established fibrotic foci in IPF. The nanocomplex consists of a PLGA core loaded with Chinese herbal tetrandrine (TET) and pirfenidone (PFD), and a macrophage cell membrane (Mφ) shell modified with collagenase type I (CLN) and collagen-targeting peptide (CBP). Following inhalation, CCMφ@PTNPs achieves precise abilities of targeting and degrading collagen barrier with the aid of CBP and CLN, ultimately achieving efficient penetration and drug delivery of fibrotic lesions in alveoli. The co-delivery of PFD and TET not only inhibited the transforming growth factor-β1(TGF-β1) pathway to achieve collagen modulation but also restored TGF-β1-induced impaired autophagy, which ultimately reduced local collagen production and accelerated clearance, thus synergistically enhancing the lung function of the bleomycin-induced mouse model. In summary, this study proposes a novel inhalation drug delivery strategy for the treatment of IPF."
"Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a chronic, progressive interstitial lung disease characterized by excessive extracellular matrix accumulation, high mortality, and limited therapeutic options. Notoginsenoside R1 (NG-R1), a major bioactive saponin derived from Panax notoginseng, possesses notable anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties, suggesting therapeutic potential in fibrotic diseases. This study evaluated the therapeutic efficacy and underlying mechanisms of NG-R1 in a mouse model of IPF induced by bleomycin (BLM), a chemotherapeutic agent commonly used to mimic pulmonary fibrosis. Network pharmacology analysis predicted that NG-R1 primarily targets pathways related to oxidative stress and immune regulation. In a BLM-induced mouse model of IPF, NG-R1 administration significantly alleviated pulmonary fibrosis, as indicated by improved lung histopathology, reduced hydroxyproline content and collagen deposition, and enhanced antioxidant enzyme activity. Mechanistic investigations revealed that NG-R1 downregulated neuropilin-1 (NRP1) expression in group 2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC2s), key mediators of type 2 immune responses and fibrotic progression. This modulation disrupted the TGF-β1/NRP1/IL-33/stimulation expressed gene 2 (ST2) signaling axis, resulting in decreased ILC2s infiltration and reduced secretion of profibrotic cytokines IL-13 and IL-5. Collectively, these findings demonstrate that NG-R1 mitigates pulmonary fibrosis by modulating innate immune responses via the NRP1/ILC2 axis, supporting its potential as a targeted immunopharmacological therapy for IPF."
"Nintedanib has been clinically proven to slow the progression of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF); however, its therapeutic utility is limited by the side effects resulting from extensive tissue distribution following oral administration. To minimize systemic exposure and related adverse effects, an inhalable dry powder formulation of nintedanib was developed to directly deliver the drug to the lung. The spray-dried formulation of nintedanib (SD-NTB), incorporating leucine as a dispersion enhancer, was successfully prepared, achieving favorable in vitro aerodynamic performance. The ex vivo fluorescence images of dissected rat lungs further confirmed successful lung deposition of SD-NTB following intratracheal insufflation. The inhalable SD-NTB formulation also demonstrated significant therapeutic efficacy by improving lung function and decreasing fibrotic cytokines in the lung. Histological analysis further supported these findings, showing reduced inflammatory infiltration and collagen deposition in the lung. The SD-NTB also demonstrated well-tolerance after consecutive administration. Pharmacokinetic analysis revealed that inhaled nintedanib remained predominantly localized in the lung with minimal systemic exposure. In conclusion, the pulmonary delivered nintedanib achieved comparable antifibrotic efficacy to oral nintedanib, but at a much lower dose and with reduced systemic exposure. These results underscore the potential of SD-NTB as a safe and effective inhalation therapy for IPF, offering substantial advantages over conventional oral delivery."
"Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a prototype of chronic, progressive, and fibrotic lung disease. Excessive deposition of extracellular matrix (ECM) results in fibrotic remodeling, alveolar destruction, and irreversible lung dysfunction. In addition to myofibroblast activation and ECM deposition, repetitive lung epithelial cell damage and reprogramming areconsidered to be closely involved in IPF pathogenesis. Transforming growth factor (TGF)-β1 plays an important role in IPF and cancer; it is a major pro-fibrotic cytokine, and is a potential target for treating fibrotic diseases.TGF-β1 binds to TGF-βRII, phosphorylating TGF-βRI, and enhances ECM expression via the suppressor of mothers against decapentaplegic (SMAD) phosphorylation signaling pathway. Current medical interventions for IPF are predominantly anti-fibrotic medications such as pirfenidone and nintedanib, which are effective in delaying lung function deterioration, reducing acute symptom exacerbations, and increasing overall life expectancy. However, these pharmaceutical agents cannot repair fibrotic pulmonary tissues or impede disease progression. To bridge this gap, we constructed a model of TGF-β1-induced fibrosis and screened for potential drugs. From 320 anti-fibrotic drugs, 9 hits were found in the TGF-β1-induced fibrosis model, and after validation, the final 7 hits were identified as TGF-β1 inhibitors. All the 7 hits were confirmed as TGF-βRI inhibitors, which showed that the model could quickly and easily discover new compounds that can act as TGF-β1 inhibitors. This study is significantbecausewe useda 3D model to swiftly and precisely identify TGF-β1 inhibitors, potentially accelerating the clinical translation of TGF-β1-targeted therapies for fibrotic diseases."
"Tissue fibrosis contributes to progressive organ dysfunction in a multitude of chronic human diseases. Despite decades of ongoing research dedicated to determining the cellular and molecular origins of fibrosis across multiple organs, we continue to lack truly impactful therapies that halt or reverse scarring. This unmet need is especially evident among individuals with fibrotic lung disease, such as idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), who frequently succumb to progressive respiratory failure a few years after diagnosis. Current therapies approved for IPF and progressive fibrotic lung diseases emerged from a longstanding drug development paradigm focused on the inhibition of pro-fibrotic drivers of fibrosis. Given that the vast majority of patients with fibrotic lung disease present with already established scarring, the relative paucity of research focused on fibrosis resolution pathways represents a glaring and critical gap in our knowledge. In contrast to the progressive pathologic fibrosis emblematic of IPF, fibrosis evolved as a self-limited wound-healing response to tissue injury, and spontaneous resolution of lung fibrosis is observed in various experimental animal models. These naturally resolving animal models of fibrosis provide an opportunity to define endogenous anti-fibrotic mediators that inhibit multiple drivers of fibrosis and can orchestrate the return of tissue homeostasis. Therapeutic restoration of these endogenous ""resolvers""-which are ostensibly disabled in states of pathologic fibrosis-has immense therapeutic potential. In this perspective, we contend that a paradigm shift in our approach toward fibrosis research is needed. Specifically, we propose that pulmonary fibrosis research be reprioritized to collectively focus on mechanisms of fibrosis resolution using rigorous methods designed to unveil, validate, and explore the therapeutic implications of endogenous resolvers."
"Anti-MDA5 dermatomyositis (anti-MDA5 DM) is a rare but severe subtype of dermatomyositis associated with high mortality. This study aimed to describe clinical characteristics and identify variables associated with rapidly progressive interstitial lung disease (RP-ILD) and mortality among affected patients. Patients diagnosed with anti-MDA5 DM between January 2013 and October 2022 were included. Demographics, clinical manifestations, and laboratory data were collected. Univariable Cox proportional hazard regression was used to assess mortality predictors, while logistic regression models identified factors associated with RP-ILD. Among 26 patients (mean age, 56.6 ± 15.1 years, 7 men), the most common clinical manifestation was Gottrón’s papules (80.8%), followed by ILD (73.1%), periungual erythema (69.2%), heliotrope rash (61.5%), V-sign (42.3%), arthritis (42.3%), weakness (38.5%), shawl sign (34.6%), mechanic’s hand (34.6%), and Raynaud’s phenomenon (19.2%). Among 19 ILD patients, 9 (47.4%) developed RP-ILD, and seven patients died over a median follow-up of 1.5 years. The overall mortality rate in this cohort was 26.9%, with 77.8% having RP-ILD. Mortality was associated with male sex (HR, 7.7; 95% CI, 1.49–39.9; <i>P</i> = 0.02) and RP-ILD, which had a risk difference of 77.8 (95% CI 50.6-104.9%; <i>P</i> = 0.001). Arthritis (<i>P</i> = 0.01) and ANA positivity (<i>P</i> = 0.03) were associated with reduced risk of RP-ILD. Patients with RP-ILD tended to receive aggressive treatments, including triple therapy regimens (55.6%), which consisted of a combination of intravenous methylprednisolone and intravenous cyclophosphamide with either rituximab or a calcineurin inhibitor. Additional treatments included intravenous immunoglobulin (22.2%) and plasma exchange (33.3%). Anti-MDA5 DM was associated with a high prevalence of ILD, particularly RP-ILD, contributing to increased mortality, underscoring the need for early identification of high-risk patients and personalized management. Male sex was a key predictor of RP-ILD and poor prognosis in anti-MDA5 dermatomyositis patients. Conversely, arthritis and ANA positivity might be associated with a lower risk of RP-ILD. Not applicable."
"Fibrotic disorders, such as idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, are characterized by the accumulation of myofibroblasts, cells responsible for excessive extracellular matrix deposition and tissue remodeling. The inability to terminate this reparative process leads to persistent fibrosis with increasing age. GHK (glycyl-L-histidyl-L-lysine], a naturally occurring peptide, has demonstrated the potential in modulating fibrotic pathways by reversing cellular senescence and inducing apoptosis in myofibroblasts. GHK promotes tissue regeneration and enhances wound healing by activating stemness markers like p63 and PCNA. In aging, GHK's effect on pulmonary fibroblasts may restore youthful phenotypes, improving fibroblast migration and collagen contraction. This commentary discusses the role of GHK in resolving persistent fibrosis and the molecular mechanisms underpinning these effects, including integrin-β1 signaling. The potential of GHK as a therapeutic agent for fibrosis, including combination strategies with antioxidants or anti-inflammatory agents, is also explored."
"An increasing body of evidence suggests that cellular senescence is a risk factor for the development of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). Cellular senescence is a permanent state by which cells cease to divide and adopt an irreversible cell cycle arrest, which is believed to contribute to aging and aging-related diseases. IPF is an age-related, chronic, progressive, and ultimately fatal interstitial lung disease of unknown etiology. IPF is characterized by repeated alveolar epithelial cell damage, fibroblast proliferation, excessive extracellular matrix (ECM) deposition, impaired gas exchange, and death. As an important transcription factor, p53 is critically involved in the regulation of senescence and fibrosis-related diseases. The mechanism of p53-mediated cellular senescence in IPF remains poorly understood, particularly regarding therapeutic strategies targeting p53. In this review, we summarize p53's structure, function, and signaling in senescence-driven IPF, and explore p53-targeted interventions for IPF. In conclusion, p53 may be a potential therapeutic target for senescence and IPF."
"Traf2- and Nck-interacting kinase (TNIK) is a crucial player in various intracellular signaling pathways, including Wnt/β-catenin, cytoskeleton organization, and immune activation. It phosphorylates several key target genes and is widely expressed in different organ systems, such as neural, gastrointestinal, lung, liver, and kidney tissues. TNIK has been implicated in multiple different disease areas, including oncology, neurological diseases, and fibrosis. This review provides an update of small molecule TNIK inhibitors in patents published from 2008 to 2024. Despite over 10 patents disclosing multiple scaffolds since 2008, only one inhibitor, INS018_055, has advanced to clinical trials to treat idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. For the oncology indications, this is largely due to complexities in the relationship between TNIK and oncogenic pathways. Additionally, key characteristics of the molecules, such as kinase selectivity, physicochemical properties and pharmacokinetic profiles, have played significant roles in determining whether the molecules are drug-like enough to advance to clinical trials."
"While aging-related diseases are often used as proxies for the general aging process in research, they largely differ in terms of how integral their development is to organismal aging. Hallmarks of aging offer a convenient conceptual framework to assess the relevance of a disease to the anti-aging narrative. In this review, we propose hallmark decomposition as a method of measuring the potential of a therapy to translate from a disease-specific treatment to a general geroprotector. To help other researchers adopt and improve this methodology, we are releasing a disease scoring system and report the hallmark alignment of 13 aging-related diseases, among which IPF is the disease most aligned with aging."
"Bronchoalveolar lavage lymphocyte percentage (BLP) is considered a prognostic marker for interstitial lung diseases (ILDs) other than idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). Its association with an early glucocorticoid response (EGR) has not been studied systematically. We aimed to assess the association of BLP and other factors with EGR. We prospectively enrolled subjects with non-IPF ILDs and treated them with glucocorticoids. We defined EGR as a composite response in symptoms and pulmonary function tests 2 months after glucocorticoid initiation. Cases were those with EGR (responders), while non-responders (without EGR) formed the controls. The primary exposure was the BLP expressed on an ordinal scale: 0%-19%, 20%-29%, 30%-39%, ≥ 40%. Confounders included age, sex, body mass index, smoke exposure, %pred FVC, symptom duration, inflammatory and/or fibrotic phenotype on chest computed tomography. We also assessed factors associated with progressive disease at 6 months. We included 150 subjects (mean age, 51.2 years; 39% men); 73% had either hypersensitivity pneumonitis or connective tissue disease-related ILD. One hundred and thirty-one subjects (69 responders; 62 non-responders) followed up at 2 months. The BLP (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 1.64; 95% confidence intervals [CI], 1.03-2.63; p = 0.04) and symptom duration (aOR, 0.60; 95% CI, 0.40-0.92; p = 0.02) were independently associated with EGR. A BLP < 20% (aOR, 4.37; 95% CI, 1.37-13.96; p = 0.01) and history of smoke exposure (aOR, 4.59; 95% CI, 1.25-16.91; p = 0.02) independently predicted progressive disease at 6 months. Higher BLPs and shorter symptom duration were associated with EGR, while BLP < 20% and smoke exposure predicted progressive disease despite glucocorticoid treatment."
"Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a progressive and fatal interstitial lung disease with limited treatment options and poor prognosis. Current therapies, Pirfenidone and Nintedanib, slow disease progression but cannot reverse established fibrosis, underscoring the urgent need for innovative strategies. Oxidative stress and hypoxia-inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α) signaling are central to IPF pathogenesis, where the interplay between reactive oxygen species (ROS), TGF-β1, and stabilized HIF-1α forms a self-perpetuating loop that promotes fibroblast activation and extracellular matrix (ECM) deposition. To interrupt this pathological cycle, we rationally designed and synthesized four small molecules, two imidazole- and two pyrrole-based derivatives, with dual antioxidants and HIF-1α inhibitory potential. Their antioxidant potential was assessed using DPPH and DCFDA assays, while density functional theory (DFT) calculations and ADME profiling confirmed their chemical stability and drug-likeness. In vitro screening identified compound 2a as the lead candidate based on its superior ability to inhibit HIF-1α and suppress fibrotic markers, including collagen III, fibronectin, and vimentin, in TGF-β1-stimulated A549 and MRC-5 cells. In vivo, 2a significantly attenuated collagen and fibronectin accumulation in a bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis model. Mechanistically, 2a inhibited phosphorylation of Smad3 and ERK, implicating modulation of both Smad and non-Smad pathways in its anti-fibrotic effects. These findings position compound 2a as a promising dual-targeted therapeutic candidate for IPF, capable of disrupting the ROS-TGF-β1-HIF-1α axis and addressing key unmet clinical needs."
"Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is characterized by the recruitment of lung fibroblasts to sites within the lung interstitium, along with the differentiation of myofibroblasts induced by transforming growth factor (TGF)-β1, a mediator of fibrosis, which, in turn, leads to accelerated contractile lung fibrotic processes with excessive extracellular matrix (ECM) deposition. Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are small particles released by cells that contain physiologically active substances, including messenger RNAs, microRNAs (miRNAs), and proteins. Although EVs derived from mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are expected to be a promising drug for various intractable diseases, including IPF, the underlying mechanisms remain elusive. In this study, we aimed to elucidate the mechanisms underlying the effect of MSC-EVs on lung fibroblast-mediated antifibrotic processes. The ability of TGF-β1-stimulated lung fibroblasts to migrate toward fibronectin and to contract three-dimensional type I collagen gels was evaluated. Using a miRNA array, we aimed to identify miRNAs associated with fibrotic mechanisms in MSC-EVs. Furthermore, the effects of MSC-EVs were analyzed in a mouse model of bleomycin (BLM)-induced lung fibrosis, including the resulting histopathology, degree of fibrosis, and downstream signaling pathways. Administration of MSC-EVs resulted in significant suppression of TGF-β1-stimulated collagen gel contraction, migration, and expression of α-smooth muscle actin and ECM. Upon treatment with MSC-EVs, lung fibroblasts derived from fibrotic lungs showed greater inhibition of responses than normal lung fibroblasts. These effects were mediated via the integrin αV-mediated focal adhesion kinase signaling through the MAPK pathway, including JNK, p38MAPK, and/or ERK1/2 signaling. miR-4516, identified in MSC-EVs in human lung fibroblasts, recapitulated these effects. Administration of MSC-EVs resulted in the significant accumulation and attenuation of BLM-induced fibrotic lung tissue, along with the reduced expression of integrin αV in the lung interstitium. Collectively, the findings of this study indicate that MSC-EVs may represent a promising novel therapeutic strategy to address the pulmonary fibroblast-mediated mechanisms of lung fibrosis."
"To evaluate the efficacy of MWA for patients aged ≥ 75 years with stage I NSCLC, and to explore the impacts of age and comorbidities on the long-term outcomes. Patients with stage I NSCLC underwent MWA between November 2016 and December 2020 were retrospectively enrolled. Patients were stratified into two cohorts: ≥ 75 years and < 75 years. Propensity score matching was implemented to control selection bias. Primary endpoints included overall survival (OS), cancer-specific survival (CSS), and recurrence-free survival (RFS). Secondary endpoints included independent risk factors influencing OS. 138 patients were successfully matched, with 69 in each group. The 1-, 3-, and 5-year OS were 95.7%, 82.6%, and 72.8% in patients aged ≥ 75 years, while 97.1%, 89.9%, and 80.3% in younger patients. There was no significant difference (p = 0.212). The 1-, 3-, and 5-year CSS were 100.0% vs. 98.6%, 92.2% vs. 92.6%, and 83.6% vs. 89.2%, respectively. No significant difference was observed (p = 0.661). The 1-, 3-, and 5-year RFS were 82.1% vs. 88.4%, 60.6% vs. 63.3%, and 58.9% vs. 61.6% without significant difference (p = 0.537). The multivariate COX analysis showed age and Charlson comorbidity index (CCI) were not prognostic factors. Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF)/chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) was an independent risk factor (95% CI 1.32-8.24; p = 0.011). MWA is an efficacious tool for patients aged ≥ 75 years with NSCLC. There are no significant differences in efficacy compared with younger patients. Age and CCI are not significant factors associated with prognosis, while IPF/COPD is an independent risk factor."
"Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a chronic and progressive lung disease with limited therapeutic options. Cyclin-dependent kinase 9 (CDK9), a key transcriptional regulator, has been implicated in fibrotic diseases, but no therapies targeting CDK9 have been developed for IPF. This investigation found that CDK9 expression was significantly elevated in IPF lung fibroblasts, correlating with an enhanced fibrogenic transcriptional profile and phenotype. Treatment with our designated CDK9 inhibitor, flavopiridol, exhibited significant anti-fibrotic effects, including suppression of fibrotic marker expression, reduction of fibroblast invasion and proliferation in vitro, and inhibition of fibroblastic lesion expansion in precision-cut lung slices ex vivo. In a bleomycin-induced mouse model of lung fibrosis, systemic administration of flavopiridol improved survival, attenuated body weight loss, and reduced fibrotic lesions and collagen deposition, outperforming the FDA-approved drug nintedanib. Further, we developed an inhalable formulation of flavopiridol and demonstrated its efficacy in mitigating fibrosis through local lung delivery, which minimized systemic drug exposure and potential adverse effects. These findings establish CDK9 as a critical regulator of lung fibrosis and provide compelling evidence for developing CDK9 inhibitors as novel therapeutic agents for IPF."
"Background Osteoprotegerin (OPG), a decoy receptor for receptor activator of NF-kB ligand (RANKL), serves as a biomarker for liver fibrosis severity. Our recent findings show OPG production in fibrotic lung tissue, though its specific cellular source and role in pulmonary fibrosis are unknown. We hypothesized that OPG is produced by fibroblasts and serves as a marker for pulmonary fibrosis progression. Methods We examined OPG expression in human and mouse control and fibrotic lung tissue and used primary human lung fibroblasts and murine precision-cut lung slices to study OPG production. Serum from idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) patients and controls was analyzed to investigate correlations between OPG levels and disease status, as measured by lung function. Results OPG-protein levels were significantly higher in murine and human fibrotic lung tissue compared to control. OPG-protein levels in fibrotic mouse lung tissue correlated positively with collagen deposition. OPG-mRNA and protein production increased in mouse lung slices upon TGFβ stimulation. Isolated lung fibroblasts from IPF patients produced more OPG-protein than controls. Serum OPG levels in IPF patients negatively correlated with diffusing capacity to carbon monoxide. Serum OPG levels above 1243 pg/ml were linked to disease progression in IPF patients. Conclusion OPG is produced in by fibroblasts in lung tissue, associates with fibrosis, and may be a potential prognostic biomarker for IPF progression. Validation in a larger cohort is necessary to further explore OPG's role in pulmonary fibrosis and its potential for assessing fibrotic lung disease prognosis in individual patients."
"Acute exacerbation of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (AE-IPF) is a severe condition with high morbidity and mortality, characterized by increased inflammation, oxidative stress, apoptosis and epithelial barrier damage. However, there are a few drugs available for the treatment of AE-IPF. Although sivelestat sodium (SIV) has been shown to be an effective agent for acute lung injury (ALI) and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) through various mechanisms, including reduction of inflammation and oxidative stress, the therapeutic potential of SIV in managing AE-IPF remains limited. This study aims to investigate the protective potential of SIV in AE-IPF mouse model through multiple mechanisms. Male C57BL/6J mice were used to establish the acute exacerbation of pulmonary fibrosis (AE-PF) mouse model through intratracheal instillation of bleomycin (BLM) followed by lipopolysaccharide (LPS). SIV was administered intraperitoneally at a dose of 100 mg/kg daily for 3 or 7 days post-LPS challenge. The therapeutic efficacy was assessed through micro-computed tomographic (Micro-CT), histopathological analysis, immunohistochemistry, immunofluorescence, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and Western blotting. SIV significantly alleviated AE-PF symptoms in mice, as demonstrated by reductions in inflammation, structural damage, and collagen formation. Additionally, SIV reduced neutrophil elastase (NE) activity, highlighting its pharmacological effectiveness. Importantly, SIV reduced oxidative stress in AE-PF mice by activating the nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2)/heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) signaling pathway, leading to increased superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity and decreased reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels. Furthermore, SIV significantly reduced lung inflammation, as evidenced by decreased interleukin-6 (IL-6) and interleukin-1 beta (IL-1β) levels in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF), possibly mediated by the inhibition of the Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4)/nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) signaling. Moreover, SIV exhibited anti-apoptotic properties by modulating the B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2)/BCL2-associated X protein (Bax)/cleaved caspase-3 pathway. Meanwhile, SIV improved epithelial barrier integrity, as shown by enhanced expression of tight junction proteins and adherens junction protein. SIV demonstrates significant protective effects in AE-PF mice by mitigating inflammation, oxidative stress, apoptosis, and preserving epithelial barrier integrity. These findings suggest that SIV is a promising therapeutic candidate for the treatment of AE-IPF."
"Immune-mediated diseases are characterized by aberrant immune responses, posing significant challenges to global health. In both inflammatory and autoimmune diseases, dysregulated immune reactions mediated by tissue-residing immune and non-immune cells precipitate chronic inflammation and tissue damage that is amplified by peripheral immune cell extravasation into the tissue. Chemokine receptors are pivotal in orchestrating immune cell migration, yet deciphering the signaling code across cell types, diseases and tissues remains an open challenge. To delineate disease-specific cell-cell communications involved in immune cell migration, we conducted a meta-analysis of publicly available single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data across diverse immune diseases and tissues. Our comprehensive analysis spanned multiple immune disorders affecting major organs: atopic dermatitis and psoriasis (skin), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (lung), ulcerative colitis (colon), IgA nephropathy and lupus nephritis (kidney). By interrogating ligand-receptor (L-R) interactions, alterations in cell proportions, and differential gene expression, we unveiled disease-specific and common cell-cell communications involved in chemotaxis and extravasation to shed light on shared immune responses across tissues and diseases. Further, we performed experimental validation of two understudied cell-cell communications. Insights gleaned from this meta-analysis hold promise for the development of targeted therapeutics aimed at modulating immune cell migration to mitigate inflammation and tissue damage. This nuanced understanding of immune cell dynamics at the single-cell resolution opens avenues for precision medicine in immune disease management."
"Lung transplantation can be lifesaving for patients with end-stage interstitial lung disease (ILD) related to connective tissue disease (CTD). However, patients with CTD-related ILD (CTD-ILD) are designated as a high-risk group for lung transplant complications due to the potential extrapulmonary manifestations of CTD. We conducted a retrospective age-matched cohort study of 34 patients with CTD-ILD and 34 patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) who underwent lung transplantation between January 2015 and March 2023. The primary outcome was survival free from allograft failure. Secondary outcomes included all-cause mortality and rates of in-hospital surgical complications and acute rejection episodes. Transplant recipients with CTD-ILD and IPF had similar rates of allograft failure and all-cause mortality. However, 3-year all-cause mortality was 5 times higher for transplant recipients with myositis-ILD (incidence rate ratio 5.02, 95% confidence intervals 1.02-24.81). While the rates of in-hospital post-transplant complications and acute rejection were similar for patients with CTD-ILD and IPF, patients with myositis had increased rates of digital ischemia, venous thromboembolism, and infection. Lung transplant recipients with CTD-ILD and IPF had similar rates of allograft failure, all-cause mortality, in-hospital complications, and acute rejection. However, these outcomes varied by CTD diagnosis such that patients with myositis-ILD had increased rates of several in-hospital complications and all-cause mortality. These novel findings provide direction for the ongoing efforts to understand and reduce the risks of lung transplantation for patients with CTD-ILD."
"Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a progressive disorder characterized by chronic inflammation and pathological lung remodeling driven by excessive extracellular matrix deposition. While the flavonol quercetin exhibits established anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties, its therapeutic mechanisms against IPF-particularly regarding epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and inflammation regulation via the follistatin-like 1 (FSTL1)/nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) axis-remain incompletely elucidated. This study therefore investigates quercetin's capacity to mitigate pulmonary fibrosis through targeted modulation of the FSTL1/NF-κB pathway. A bleomycin (BLM)-induced pulmonary fibrosis mouse model and Transforming Growth Factor Beta 1 (TGF-β1)-induced EMT models in A549 and BEAS-2B cells were employed. The therapeutic effects of quercetin were assessed through H&E, Masson, Sirius red staining, immunofluorescence, quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR), and Western blotting. The role of FSTL1 and NF-κB signaling in the anti-fibrotic effects of quercetin was evaluated using FSTL1 knockdown. <i>In vivo</i> studies have shown that BLM-induced pulmonary fibrosis and inflammation significantly increased the deposition of extracellular matrix and the levels of interleukin-1 beta (IL-1β), monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1), and interleukin 6 (IL-6), all of which were markedly reduced by quercetin administration. <i>In vitro</i> experiments revealed that quercetin suppressed TGF-β1-induced EMT and inflammation. Importantly, FSTL1 knockdown diminished the anti-inflammatory and anti-EMT effects of quercetin. Quercetin exerts its protective effects against pulmonary fibrosis by suppressing FSTL1 expression and modulating the NF-κB signaling pathway, thereby inhibiting both inflammation and EMT process."
"Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a progressive fibrosing lung disease characterized by chronic inflammation, vascular remodeling, and immune dysregulation. COVID-19, caused by SARS-CoV-2, shares several systemic immunohematologic disturbances with IPF, including cytokine storms, endothelial injury, and prothrombotic states. Unlike general comparisons of viral infections and chronic lung disease, this review offers a focused analysis of the shared hematologic and immunologic mechanisms between COVID-19 and IPF. Our aim is to better understand how SARS-CoV-2 infection may worsen disease progression in IPF and identify converging pathophysiological pathways that may inform clinical management. We conducted a narrative synthesis of the peer-reviewed literature from PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science, focusing on clinical, experimental, and pathological studies addressing immune and coagulation abnormalities in both COVID-19 and IPF. Both diseases exhibit significant overlap in inflammatory and fibrotic signaling, particularly via the TGF-β, IL-6, and TNF-α pathways. COVID-19 amplifies coagulation disturbances and endothelial dysfunction already present in IPF, promoting microvascular thrombosis and acute exacerbations. Myeloid cell overactivation, impaired lymphocyte responses, and fibroblast proliferation are central to this shared pathophysiology. These synergistic mechanisms may accelerate fibrosis and increase mortality risk in IPF patients infected with SARS-CoV-2. This review proposes an integrative framework for understanding the hematologic and immunologic convergence of COVID-19 and IPF. Such insights are essential for refining therapeutic targets, improving prognostic stratification, and guiding early interventions in this high-risk population."
"Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a chronic, progressive interstitial lung disease with limited therapeutic options and increasing global incidence, with a median survival of only 2-5 years. The clinical utility of macrophage polarization to regulate the progression of pulmonary fibrosis remains understudied. This study determined the efficacy of nintedanib and pexidartinib (PLX3397) combination therapy for treating IPF. Combination treatment effectively inhibited the progression of radiation-induced pulmonary fibrosis (RIPF) and prolonged survival in bleomycin-treated mice. Micro-CT analysis revealed a significant tissue repair efficacy. The therapy significantly normalized the abnormal vascular structure observed during RIPF and bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis progression and was accompanied by a decrease in the M2 population. Polarized M1 macrophages enhanced normalized tube formation of irradiated endothelial cells (ECs) in vitro; M2 macrophages increased adhesion in irradiated ECs and abnormal tube formation. Single-cell RNA sequencing data from patients with IPF further supports colony stimulating factor (CSF) 1 upregulation in macrophages and downregulation of capillary EC markers. This study highlights a promising combination strategy to overcome the therapeutic limitations of monotherapy with nintedanib for the treatment of IPF."
"We report a rare case of the independent coexistence of lung cancer and organizing pneumonia (OP) in different lobes of the right lung in a 67-year-old man with a history of left upper lobectomy. Computed tomography revealed a lesion consistent with OP in the right upper lobe and a suspicious shadow in the right lower lobe, which was diagnosed as squamous cell carcinoma via bronchoscopic biopsy. The patient underwent right lower lobectomy and partial resection of the right upper lobe under left one-lung ventilation. Empirical corticosteroids were administered preoperatively, followed by a brief postoperative course for 3 days after pathological confirmation of OP to reduce complications such as bronchial fistula, then transitioned to macrolide therapy for 3 months. Fourteen months postoperatively, OP had not recurred, although bone metastases developed and responded well to chemoradiotherapy. This case highlights the need for individualized perioperative management in patients with complex pulmonary pathology."
"Interstitial lung disease (ILD) represents a heterogeneous group of diseases in which inflammation and/or fibrosis in the pulmonary interstitium results in an impaired gas exchange, difficulties in breathing, and reduced quality of daily life, and contributes to elevated global morbidity and mortality rates. ILD is an umbrella term, with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) being a prime focus because of its progressive and severe form. Out of 300 underlying etiologies, ILD is one of the major reasons for global morbidity and mortality. This review offers a comprehensive overview of six main categories of ILD covering autoimmune, idiopathic interstitial pneumonia, hypersensitivity pneumonitis, drug-induced, infection-related, and unclassified ILD that underscore the complexity of diagnosis and treatment challenges. This review also provides an evidence-based overview of recent advancements in the diagnosis and management of ILD, with precision pharmacotherapy, multidisciplinary care, and emerging therapeutic strategies. From clinical trial data, it also recommends the disease-specific use of pharmacological agents-such as pirfenidone and nintedanib for IPF, and mycophenolate mofetil for connective tissue disease-associated ILD. The manuscript also emphasizes the evolving role of non-pharmacological interventions, including the 6-minute walk test and pulmonary rehabilitation, in enhancing functional capacity and quality of life. To address the current global health concerns, topics of post-COVID-19 ILD and immune checkpoint inhibitor-associated lung disease are integrated. Additionally, future directions are explored, including the role of lung transplantation and novel antifibrotic therapies like anti-Transforming Growth Factor (TGF)-β antibody cocktails. Together, these insights aim to refine diagnostic precision, personalize treatment, and improve clinical outcomes across the heterogeneous ILD spectrum."
"Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a rare, chronic and progressive lung disease with a significant impact on patients' quality of life. While much research has focused on disease mechanisms and treatment efficacy, limited attention has been paid to the landscape, unmet needs, patient experiences and quality of life. Understanding these aspects through the patient journey is essential for developing patient-centred therapeutic strategies. Therefore, this study aims to explore the status of diagnosis, treatment, the unmet needs and patient experiences of IPF in China through an analysis of the patient journey using mixed methods research. The findings in this study provide valuable insights to guide drug development, optimise clinical decision-making and support health technology assessments. An exploratory sequential mixed methods design will be used in two phases. In the qualitative phase, 50 patients with IPF and 15 experienced physicians will be recruited to complete in-depth interviews. Patient journey and unmet medical needs will be the focus of data collection. Based on the findings of the qualitative study, a structured questionnaire will be developed for the subsequent quantitative study. Data will be collected from 245 patients with IPF to quantitatively analyse critical points in the patient journey, quality of life, unmet needs and treatment expectations. The integration of patient experience data into the drug/intervention development lifecycle in this mixed methods research will enhance the relevance of IPF interventions, optimising disease management strategies and improving patient health outcomes. The study has been approved by the Peking University Third Hospital Medical Science Research Ethics Committee (2024-188-02). Prior to the study, study information will be provided, and consent will be obtained. Findings in this study will be disseminated in peer-reviewed publications and conferences. NCT06629623."
"Senescence, a state of permanent cell cycle arrest, is a complex cellular phenomenon closely affiliated with age-related diseases and pathological fibrosis. Cellular senescence is now recognized as a significant contributor to organ fibrosis, largely driven by transforming growth factor beta (TGF-β) signaling, such as in metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH), idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), chronic kidney disease (CKD), and myocardial fibrosis, which can lead to heart failure, cystic fibrosis, and fibrosis in pancreatic tumors, to name a few. MASH is a progressive inflammatory and fibrotic liver condition that has reached pandemic proportions, now considered the largest non-viral contributor to the need for liver transplantation. We previously studied Oxy210, an anti-fibrotic and anti-inflammatory, orally bioavailable, oxysterol-based drug candidate for MASH, using APOE*3-Leiden.CETP mice, a humanized hyperlipidemic mouse model that closely recapitulates the hallmarks of human MASH. In this model, treatment of mice with Oxy210 for 16 weeks caused significant amelioration of the disease, evidenced by reduced hepatic inflammation, lipid deposition, and fibrosis, atherosclerosis and adipose tissue inflammation. Here we demonstrate increased hepatic expression of senescence-associated genes and senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP), correlated with the expression of pro-fibrotic and pro-inflammatorygenes in these mice during the development of MASH that are significantly inhibited by Oxy210. Using the HepG2 human hepatocyte cell line, we demonstrate the induced expression of senescent-associated genes and SASP by TGF-β and inhibition by Oxy210. These findings further support the potential therapeutic effects of Oxy210 mediated in part through inhibition of senescence-driven hepatic fibrosis and inflammation in MASH and perhaps in other senescence-associated fibrotic diseases."
"There have been multiple observational studies that have established a link between metabolite levels in the body and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), specifically focusing on metabolites derived from fatty acids. However, a complete understanding of the precise molecular and biological factors, as well as the causality between them, remains elusive. The main objective of our study was to evaluate the potential causal relationship between blood metabolites and IPF by using Mendelian randomization (MR). To achieve this goal, we utilized the most comprehensive genome-wide association study to date, which identified genetic variants associated with blood metabolites (1091 blood metabolites and 309 metabolite ratios). Summary statistics of IPF were collected from Finngen R8 (1812 IPF patients and 338,784 controls), inverse variance weighted method (IVW) is used as the main method in determining causality. Isovalerylcarnitine (C5) levels (OR = 1.2435, 95% CI: 1.0494-1.4736, Pval = .0119) was found significantly related to higher risk of IPF. There was no significant heterogeneity in our study (IVW method: Pval = .132; MR-Egger method: Pval = .105) and horizontal pleiotropy (β = -0.027; SE = 0.0337; Pval = .4310). The sensitivity analysis did not reveal any potential abnormal drivers (0.1 < All < 0.3). Two-sample MR method demonstrated the causal relationship between blood metabolites and IPF, and further studies found that Isovalerylcarnitine (C5) levels, as a potential biological risk factor for IPF, may provide a new target for the treatment of IPF."
"Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a devastating chronic lung disorder with limited treatment options. Macropinocytosis is one of the key cellular processes involved in nutrient consumption from the extracellular environment under stress conditions. Here, we studied the role of macropinocytosis in lung fibroblast activation and experimental pulmonary fibrosis. We found that macropinocytosis is increased in human lung fibroblasts (HLFs) derived from IPF patients. The inhibition of macropinocytosis with 5-(n-ethyl-n-isopropyl)-amiloride (EIPA) significantly inhibited profibrotic responses in IPF-derived and TGF-β1-stimulated HLFs. EIPA exerted antifibrotic effects by regulating amino acid (AA) uptake, mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) activation and mesenchyme homeobox1 (MEOX1) expression in activated HLFs. Both genetic and pharmacological inhibition of macropinocytosis significantly ameliorated pulmonary fibrosis in bleomycin (Bleo)-injured mice. Using IPF-derived precision cut lung slices (PCLS), we observed robust repression of profibrotic gene expression programs in EIPA-treated PCLS across different fibroblast subpopulations. Finally, we found that imipramine (Imi), a tricyclic antidepressant approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), effectively inhibited macropinocytosis and ameliorated profibrotic responses in lung fibroblasts, Bleo-injured mice and IPF-derived PCLS. Taken together, our results suggest macropinocytosis inhibition as a potential therapeutic strategy to treat pulmonary fibrosis."
"YAP/TAZ signaling is required for initiation of lung alveolar repair, yet previous studies in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) predicted increased YAP/TAZ signaling in alveolar epithelial cells (AECs). We investigated whether persistent YAP/TAZ AEC signaling contributes to failed epithelial repair and persistent fibrotic remodeling. In IPF lungs, we identified increased YAP<sup>+</sup>/TAZ<sup>+</sup> AECs and increased expression of YAP/TAZ transcriptional targets compared to donor control lungs. In human lung organoids, pharmacological YAP/TAZ activation resulted in phenotype shifts of AECs into aberrant transitional states. In mice with Yap/Taz activation (YT<sup>active</sup>) resulting from deletion of Hippo-kinases Stk3/4 in alveolar-type 2 (AT2) cells, resulted in persistent fibrotic remodeling at 28- and 56-days post-bleomycin injury. Gene promoter activity associated with transitional cell markers (<i>Krt19, Hopx,</i> and <i>Runx2</i>) was increased in YT<sup>active</sup> AT2 cells. Immunofluorescent staining showed a loss of AT2 associated Cebpa and increased <i>Krt19</i> in YT<sup>active</sup> lineage traced AT2 cells 28 days post-injury. Inhibition of Yap/Taz using Verteporfin resulted in improved lung repair in YT<sup>active</sup> mouse lungs, including increased Cebpa and decreased <i>Krt19<sup>+</sup></i> transitional cells. These findings demonstrate sustained Yap/Taz activation drives abnormal alveolar repair and persistent fibrotic remodeling. Blocking aberrant persistent Yap/Taz activity promotes adaptive repair and has potential as a therapeutic strategy for PF."
"Nintedanib (Nint) is a potent tyrosine kinase inhibitor recently approved by the US FDA to treat idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). Delivery of Nint through available approaches is highly challenging because of its poor solubility and rapid metabolic degradation via hydrolytic ester cleavage, thereby reflecting poor oral bioavailability (< 5%). Hence, the current study was focused on formulating a Nint-loaded microemulsion (Nint-ME) and investigating its therapeutic potential in experimental animals to overcome the constraints of available therapies. Nint-ME was prepared via low-energy O/W emulsification aqueous titration techniques and optimized using QbD approach. Optimized ME subjected to screen for globule size, polydispersity index, encapsulation efficiency, transmittance, surface charge, and viscosity and were found to be 23.8 ± 1.4 nm, 0.18 ± 0.03, 99.8 ± 2.4%, 99.4 ± 0.1%, -0.7 ± 0.01 mV, and 1.5 ± 0.3 cP, respectively. Additionally, 94.5 ± 3.1% Nint was released from Nint-ME through the dialysis cassette within 72 h, demonstrating first-order kinetics with R<sup>2</sup> of 0.966. First-order and Higuchi release kinetic patterns support concentration-dependent release and Fickian diffusion from the matrix of Nint-ME. In-vitro permeation study of Nint across Caco2 colon epithelial cell monolayer depicted 48.1 ± 1.5 µg of cellular permeation out of 50 µg, ensuring the permeation potential of Nint-ME. Concurrently, an in-vivo pharmacokinetic study for optimized Nint-ME against Nint suspension reflected 41.0 ± 12.5% oral bioavailability, a 2-fold enhancement compared to plain Nint suspension. Existing work demonstrated the successful development of oral Nint-ME as a novel formulation for safe and effective delivery of Nint in IPF."
"Patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) undergoing lung cancer surgery face a 4.4-20 % risk of acute exacerbation (AE-IPF) with mortality exceeding 50 %. The potential role of perioperative antifibrotic therapy in reducing surgical complications in this high-risk population remains unclear. To evaluate whether perioperative antifibrotic therapy (pirfenidone/nintedanib) reduces complications, particularly acute exacerbations and mortality, in IPF patients undergoing lung cancer surgery through systematic review and meta-analysis. Following PRISMA guidelines, we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of observational studies examining perioperative antifibrotic therapy in IPF patients undergoing lung cancer surgery. Four studies comprising 261 patients (124 treated, 137 controls) from Japan and Italy (2016-2024) were analyzed. Pooled risk ratios were calculated using Review Manager 5.4. The study protocol was registered with PROSPERO (ID: CRD42025649005). Perioperative antifibrotic therapy achieved a 69 % reduction in AE-IPF risk (RR 0.31, 95 % CI 0.13-0.70) and an 81 % reduction in 90-day mortality (RR 0.19, 95 % CI 0.07-0.52). Additional benefits included significantly shorter hospital stays (5 vs 7 days, p = 0.029) and reduced complications, including decreased prolonged air leak rates (3.4 % vs 26.9 %). Adverse events were minimal, consisting primarily of mild nausea and photosensitivity. Perioperative antifibrotic therapy significantly reduces acute exacerbations and mortality in IPF patients undergoing lung cancer surgery. However, findings are limited by small observational studies concentrated in specific geographic regions. Randomized controlled trials are needed to confirm efficacy and establish standardized treatment protocols."
"Pulmonary fibrosis is characterized by irreversible destruction of alveolar structure and excessive deposition of extracellular matrix. Although animal models have been widely used in pulmonary fibrosis research, none of the currently available models fully recapitulate the progressive nature of IPF or its defining histological feature, such as fibroblastic foci. Advanced in vitro models, including precision-cut lung slices (PCLS), are often considered the most physiologically relevant pulmonary test system and have been successfully employed for drug screening. Nevertheless, the inability to differentiate the degree of fibrosis in the IPF lung has resulted in blinding and uncertainty in the PCLS obtained. Previous research demonstrated that fibroblast activation protein (FAP) could evaluate the pro-fibrotic activity of ILD, potentially contributing to early diagnosis and the selection of appropriate therapeutic windows. In this study, 600 µm PCLS will be obtained from healthy donors and IPF patients using a shock slicer and evaluated using molecular probes targeting FAP to determine the degree of fibroblast activity based on fluorescent signal intensity. This approach provides an advanced in vitro model and evaluation technique for pulmonary fibrosis research, enhancing the ability to study disease mechanisms and assess therapeutic interventions."
"Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a chronic progressive form of interstitial lung disease and is pathologically featured by excessive deposition of extracellular matrix in response to repetitive epithelial injury. Burgeoning evidence suggests that ketone body exerts a beneficial effect on oxidative stress and on different types of fibrotic diseases, including cardiac fibrosis, hepatic fibrosis, and renal fibrosis. However, its effect on IPF is largely unknown. In vitro in alveolar epithelial cells type II (AECII) exposed to bleomycin, β-hydroxybutyrate (BHB) treatment substantially mitigated cellular ferroptosis, as evidenced by enhanced cell viability, reduced iron content, and reduced lipid peroxidation. This beneficial action of BHB coincided with a reinforced de novo glutathione synthesis and increased glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4) antioxidant response. Mechanistically, BHB promoted the expression of glutamate-cysteine ligase catalytic subunit (GCLC), the rate-limiting enzyme in de novo glutathione synthesis. Indeed, RSL3, a selective inhibitor of GPX4, or knockdown of GCLC abolished, whereas selective activation of GPX4 was sufficient for the antiferroptosis and AECII protective effects of BHB. In murine models of bleomycin-induced IPF, BHB therapy promoted the expression of GCLC and reinforced GPX4 activity in AECII, resulting in lessened AECII ferroptosis and improved lung injury and fibrosis. Thus, our findings may pave the way for developing a BHB-based novel approach to therapeutic ketosis for treating IPF."
"This updated systematic review and meta-analysis pooled the results of previous clinical trials assessing the effects of pirfenidone and nintedanib on patients with pulmonary fibrosis. Scopus, the Cochrane Library, PubMed, and Web of Science were searched from the inception to April 12, 2025, to identify randomized controlled trials measuring the effect of pirfenidone and nintedanib on pulmonary fibrosis. Because of high methodological heterogeneity, we utilized a random-effects model (DerSimonian-Laird) to perform this meta-analysis. Finally, 18 articles with 20 randomized controlled trials were included in this meta-analysis. We found that compared to placebo, treatment with the two antifibrotic drugs increased forced vital capacity (FVC) predicted (weighted mean difference [WMD] 3.12%, 95% confidence interval [CI] [1.41, 4.82], <i>I</i> <sup>2</sup> = 53.30%), FVC volume (WMD 87.44 ml, 95% CI [59.32, 115.57], <i>I</i> <sup>2</sup> = 99.4%), and the distance walked in the 6-minute walk test (WMD 24.63 m, 95% CI [16.05, 33.22], <i>I</i> <sup>2</sup> = 0.00%). However, compared to placebo, treatment with the two antifibrotic drugs did not significantly change the diffusing capacity of the lungs for carbon monoxide (WMD 1.38 ml/min/mmHg, 95% CI [-9.42, 12.18], <i>I</i> <sup>2</sup> = 0.00%). Therapeutic benefits were observed for both pirfenidone and nintedanib and for both idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) and non-IPF. Pirfenidone and nintedanib can improve lung function and functional capacity in patients with different types of pulmonary fibrosis."
"In patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), computed tomography (CT) quantification using artificial intelligence (AI) has been explored as a method to assess the therapeutic response to antifibrotic agents; however, studies evaluating long-term follow-up outcomes remain scarce. We investigated AI-driven quantitative analysis for long-term follow-up chest CT of IPF patients undergoing pirfenidone treatment. Among the 2,223 patients diagnosed with interstitial lung disease by chest CT at Jeonbuk National University Hospital, 36 patients with a multidisciplinary diagnosis of IPF were included in the study after excluding those who had not undergone surgical lung biopsy or did not have available pulmonary function tests (PFTs). These 36 patients underwent high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) along with concurrent PFTs over a 10-year period and were categorized into two groups: those treated with pirfenidone (n=17) and those not treated with pirfenidone (n=19). Quantitative texture analysis was performed using a deep convolutional neural network to calculate fibrotic scores, defined as the combined mean percentage of two fibrotic components-reticulation and honeycombing, with or without accompanying ground-glass opacities-across the entire lung. This analysis aimed to assess treatment response in IPF patients receiving pirfenidone. Repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to evaluate the correlation between changes in pulmonary function and fibrotic scores over time. The final study population comprised 36 patients, with a mean age of 67.1±7.7 years. Patients (DLCO: 58.0%±21.0%) who received pirfenidone (n=17) exhibited lower DLCO values at the final follow-up compared to the untreated group (n=19) (DLCO: 69.0%±21.7%), although the difference was not statistically significant (P=0.260). However, in the treated group (n=17), patients with progression despite pirfenidone treatment (n=6) (fibrotic score: 27.1%±12.1%) showed a markedly greater increase in mean AI fibrotic scores at the final follow-up compared to those with no or little change (n=11) (fibrotic score: 10.9%±8.7%), with the difference approaching statistical significance (P=0.076). There was a significant correlation between the decrease in DLCO values and the increase in AI fibrotic score in patients with pirfenidone on long-term follow-up (P<0.01). AI-driven quantitative analysis of HRCT images in patients with IPF enables objective monitoring of the effects of pirfenidone on the progression of pulmonary fibrosis on long-term follow-up."
"Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a progressive and incurable lung disease characterized by tissue scarring that disrupts gas exchange. Epithelial cell dysfunction, fibroblast activation, and excessive extracellular matrix deposition drive this pathology that ultimately leads to respiratory failure. Mechanistic studies have shown that repeated injury to alveolar epithelial cells initiates an aberrant wound-healing response by surrounding fibroblasts through secretion of mediators like transforming growth factor beta (TGF- β), yet the precise biological pathways contributing to disease progression are not fully understood. To better study these interactions there is a critical need for lung models that replicate the cellular heterogeneity, geometry, and biomechanics of the distal lung microenvironment. In this study, induced pluripotent stem cell-derived alveolar epithelial type II (iATII) cells and human pulmonary fibroblasts were arranged to replicate key features of human lung micro-architecture and embedded in soft or stiff poly(ethylene glycol) norbornene (PEG-NB) hydrogels that recapitulated the mechanical properties of healthy and fibrotic lung tissue, respectively. The co-cultured cells were then exposed to pro-fibrotic cytokines and growth factors. iATIIs and fibroblasts exhibited differentiation pathways and gene expression patterns consistent with trends observed during IPF progression in vivo. A design of experiments statistical analysis identified stiff hydrogels combined with pro-fibrotic biochemical cue exposure as the most effective condition tested in this study for modeling fibrosis in vitro. Finally, treatment with Nintedanib, one of only two Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved drugs for IPF, was assessed. Treatment reduced fibroblast activation, as indicated by downregulation of key activation genes, and upregulated several epithelial genes involved in alveolar repair. These findings demonstrate that human 3D co-culture models hold are a promising tool for advancing our understanding of IPF and identifying new therapeutic targets. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: This study leverages advanced biomaterials and biofabrication techniques to engineer physiologically relevant, donor-specific, and sex-matched models of pulmonary fibrosis, addressing the critical need for pre-clinical therapeutic drug screening platforms. These human 3D lung models successfully replicated key features of fibrotic lung tissue. Tuning microenvironmental stiffness of 3D PEG-NB hydrogels to match fibrotic lung values and exposing human iATII cells and fibroblasts to pro-fibrotic biochemical cues recreated hallmark characteristics of in vivo fibrosis pathogenesis, including epithelial differentiation and loss, as well as fibroblast activation. The utility of these models was further validated by demonstrating responsiveness to Nintedanib, a clinically available treatment for IPF. These findings highlight the transformative potential of well-defined biomaterial-based 3D models for elucidating complex disease mechanisms and accelerating therapeutic drug discovery for chronic pulmonary diseases like idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis."
"Research has shown that long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) play a role in Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis (IPF), but their specific functions and patterns of expression are still unclear. A diagnostic study was conducted by utilizing analysis techniques. RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) data from 12 IPF patients and 5 controls was used to study lncRNA functions in IPF. The authors identified Differentially Expressed lncRNAs (DElncRNAs) and explored co-expression networks in a transient manner, as well as using Weighted Gene Co-expression Network Analysis (WGCNA) to identify modules associated with IPF. The study found 541 differentially expressed lncRNAs in IPF, with 201 up-regulated and 340 down-regulated. DElncRNAs, especially the up-regulated, were significantly correlated with DEmRNAs at their expression levels. DEmRNAs showed extracellular matrix-related biological functions in addition to increased lncRNAs. WGCNA results demonstrated that Module Eigengene green (MEgreen) and MEred modules indicated the highest negative correlation significance with IPF phenotype, and eigengene patterns of both modules were downregulated in IPF samples. The authors identified six significant lncRNAs in these two modules, including FAM13A-AS1, RP11-180C16.1, MYO16-AS1, AC007278.2, BACH1-IT2, and RP11-153M7.5, and their co-expressed DE mRNAs were enriched in inflammatory response pathways. The authors used single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data to investigate dysregulated lncRNAs and their co-expressed mRNAs. The authors found that five DEmRNAs that were co-expressed with DElncRNAs exhibited dysregulated expression patterns in multiple cell types of the IPF samples. LncRNAs are functionally active and potentially involved in the inflammatory response in pathological processes of IPF. It is also important to consider some specific lncRNAs as potential diagnostic biomarkers or therapeutic targets for preclinical and clinical studies with IPF in the future."
"Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a condition predominantly affecting the elderly and leading to a decline in lung function. Our study investigates the aging-related mechanisms in IPF using artificial intelligence (AI) approaches. We developed a pathway-aware proteomic aging clock using UK Biobank data and applied it alongside a specialized version of Precious3GPT (ipf-P3GPT) to demonstrate an AI-driven mode of IPF research. The aging clock shows great performance in cross-validation (R<sup>2</sup>=0.84) and its utility is validated in an independent dataset to show that severe cases of COVID-19 are associated with an increased aging rate. Computational analysis using ipf-P3GPT revealed distinct but overlapping molecular signatures between aging and IPF, suggesting that IPF represents a dysregulation rather than mere acceleration of normal aging processes. Our findings establish novel connections between aging biology and IPF pathogenesis while demonstrating the potential of AI-guided approaches in therapeutic development for age-related diseases."
"Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a kind of chronic and progressive interstitial lung disease of unclear aetiology. A key aspect of IPF is transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1)-induced mitophagy dysfunction and senescence in lung fibroblasts. Mesenchyme homeobox 1 (MEOX1) is a critical transcription factor in the regulation of cell differentiation. However, the role of MEOX1 in the pathogenesis of lung fibrosis and mitophagy has not been clarified. In this study, RNA-sequencing analysis was employed to identify the differentially expressed genes in TGF-β1-treated lung fibroblasts and IPF lung tissue. In vivo, the mouse model of lung fibrosis was established by intratracheal injection of bleomycin (BLM), and fibroblast-specific knockdown of MEOX in mice was achieved by intratracheal injection of adeno-associated viruse-shMEOX1. And in vitro experiments were also carried out on human lung fibroblasts. Our results indicated that fibroblast-specific knockdown of MEOX1 protected mice from BLM-induced pulmonary fibrosis, connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) expression, and lung fibroblast activation, as well as mitophagy deficiency and senescence. In vitro, MEOX1 knockdown abolished TGF-β1-induced mitophagy deficiency by downregulating CTGF expression, thereby inhibiting senescence, over-activation and collagen production in lung fibroblasts. Furthermore, we also found that TGF-β1 upregulated the expression of MEOX1 through the NOX4-ROS-Smad pathway. In conclusion, MEOX1 knockdown may ameliorate pulmonary fibrosis by regulating mitophagy and senescence and may be a potential therapeutic target for IPF and other types of interstitial lung diseases."
"Interstitial lung disease (ILD) is associated with morbidity and mortality in idiopathic inflammatory myopathies (IIM). Predicting ILD progression remains a significant challenge, as conventional diagnostic tools such as pulmonary function tests (PFTs) and high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) have limited prognostic accuracy. This study evaluated whether <sup>68</sup>Ga-labelled inhibitor of Fibroblast-Activation-Protein (FAPI) based PET/CT at baseline predicts ILD evolution over two years. In this prospective observational study, n = 19 individuals with IIM (n = 14 with ILD) underwent [<sup>68</sup>Ga] Ga-FAPI PET/CT at baseline. ILD progression was defined by three criteria: (1) FVC decline ≥10 % or FVC 5-9 % plus DLCO decline ≥15 %, (2) INBUILD criteria, and (3) a composite endpoint including INBUILD plus therapy escalation, hospitalization, or mortality. Pulmonary tracer uptake was quantified by calculating the maximum and mean target-to-background ratios across the whole lung (wlTBR<sub>max</sub> and wlTBR<sub>mean</sub>, respectively), derived from standardized uptake values corrected for blood pool activity, and their predictive value was analysed. Over two years, n = 4 (28.6 %) patients met PFT-based progression criteria, while n = 6 (42.9 %) fulfilled INBUILD criteria, and n = 8 (57.1 %) reached the composite endpoint. Baseline wlTBR<sub>max</sub> was significantly higher in INBUILD progressors compared to non-progressors (2.68 ± 1.06 vs. 1.59 ± 0.80, p = 0.04), as was wlTBR<sub>mean</sub> (0.58 ± 0.22 vs. 0.34 ± 0.10, p = 0.04). Similarly, patients meeting the composite endpoint had higher wlTBR<sub>max</sub> (2.63 ± 1.04 vs. 1.30 ± 0.31; p < 0.01) and wlTBR<sub>mean</sub> (0.55 ± 0.20 vs. 0.31 ± 0.09; p = 0.01). Logistic regression analysis showed that incorporating pulmonary wlTBR<sub>max</sub> and wlTBR<sub>mean</sub> enhanced the predictive accuracy over PFT and HRCT alone. FAPI PET/CT may serve as a non-invasive biomarker for early prediction of ILD progression in IIM, supporting personalized disease management. However, given the small, single-centre cohort, these findings should be considered as preliminary and require validation in larger, multi-centre studies."
"Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a progressive interstitial lung disease marked by aberrant fibroblast-to-myofibroblast differentiation, a process that requires metabolic reprogramming. We identify alanine as a critical metabolite that confers metabolic flexibility to support differentiation. TGF-β increases alanine by activating both its synthesis and import in normal and IPF lung fibroblasts. Alanine is synthesized primarily by GPT2, which is regulated by a glutamine-glutamate-α-ketoglutarate axis. Inhibiting GPT2 depletes alanine and suppresses TGF-β-induced expression of α-SMA and COL1A1, an effect reversed by alanine supplementation. We also identify SLC38A2 as a key transporter of both alanine and glutamine that is upregulated by TGF-β and alanine deprivation. Together, SLC38A2 and GPT2 activities converge to maintain intracellular alanine levels to support myofibroblast differentiation. Mechanistically, alanine deficiency suppresses glycolysis and depletes tricarboxylic acid cycle intermediates, while supplementation provides carbon and nitrogen for intracellular glutamate and proline biosynthesis, particularly in the absence of glutamine. Combined inhibition of GPT2 and SLC38A2 suppresses fibrogenic responses in fibroblasts and in human precision-cut lung slices, highlighting a potential therapeutic strategy for fibrotic lung disease."
"Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a fatal lung disease for which novel therapeutic approaches are desperately needed. Inhibitor of DNA binding (ID) proteins are regulated by Transforming Growth Factor-b. However, the regulation and the effects of ID proteins in IPF remain poorly understood. We aimed to assess the expression of ID proteins in IPF and determine the effects of ID proteins on human lung fibroblasts (HLF) <i>in vitro</i> and pulmonary fibrosis <i>in vivo</i>. The expression of ID proteins in lungs and lung fibroblasts from mice and human patients with pulmonary fibrosis was evaluated. The effects of ID1/ID3 inhibition and overexpression on HLF were assessed. Genetic and pharmacological approaches were used <i>in vivo</i> to determine the role of ID1/ID3 in pulmonary fibrosis. ID1/ID3 levels were elevated in HLFs isolated from pulmonary fibrosis-diseased patients and mice. ID1/ID3 knockdown decreased IPF-diseased HLF proliferation and differentiation into myofibroblasts. Bleomycin-exposed ID1/ID3 KO mice displayed improved lung function and presented with decreased lung fibrosis when compared to WT mice. A pharmacological inhibitor of ID1/ID3 decreased IPF-diseased HLF proliferation and differentiation <i>in vitro</i> and attenuated pulmonary fibrosis <i>in vivo</i>. A lung specific inhibition of ID1/ID3, using adeno-associated viruses expressing short hairpins targeting ID1 and ID3, reversed pulmonary fibrosis in mice. Mechanistically, ID1/ID3 inhibition decreased fibroblast proliferation through cell cycle genes and inhibited fibroblast differentiation through the MEK/ERK pathway. Our data indicate that a simultaneous inhibition of ID1 and ID3 attenuates pulmonary fibrosis. ID1/ID3 inhibition holds potential as a novel therapeutic treatment for IPF."
"Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), the most common interstitial lung disease, has a severe prognosis, and its diagnosis is difficult. Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) play crucial roles in the mechanism of IPF and exhibit great potential as biomarkers. Past research found that HOXD antisense growth-associated lncRNA (HAGLR) was elevated in IPF. Therefore, this study assessed the diagnostic utility and function of HAGLR in IPF. HAGLR expression was screened in the Gene Expression Omnibus datasets. Then, the serum specimens and clinical information of 66 patients with IPF, 93 patients with interstitial lung disease (ILD) without IPF, 61 patients with pneumonia, and 58 healthy controls were simultaneously collected. HAGLR expression was tested in all subjects and analyzed using receiver operating characteristic curves to verify the clinical utility of HAGLR. Then, the effects of HAGLR inhibition on fibrosis-related gene and protein expression in a cell model of fibrosis were investigated by quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and western blotting. HAGLR expression was higher in patients with IPF than in healthy controls, patients with ILD without IPF, and patients with pneumonia. The ROC curve analysis illustrated that HAGLR can distinguish patients with IPF from healthy controls. A model combining clinical items (including age, gender, routine blood test, tumor biomarkers, and cytokines), with HAGLR displayed good clinical value, with an are under the curve of 0.994, sensitivity of 100.0% and specificity of 91.4%. Upon HAGLR inhibition, fibrosis proteins were downregulated. HAGLR has utility in the auxiliary diagnosis of IPF, as it can differentiate IPF from other conditions. HAGLR inhibition could alleviate fibrosis at the cellular level."
"Interstitial lung disease (ILD) prognostication incorporates clinical history, pulmonary function testing (PFTs), and chest CT pattern classifications. The machine learning classifier, Fibresolve, includes a model to help detect CT patterns associated with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). We developed and tested new Fibresolve software to predict outcomes in patients with ILD. Fibresolve uses a transformer (ViT) algorithm to analyze CT imaging that additionally embeds PFTs, age, and sex to produce an overall risk score. The model was trained to optimize risk score in a dataset of 602 subjects designed to maximize predictive performance via Cox proportional hazards. Validation was completed with the first hazard ratio assessment dataset, then tested in a second datatest set. 61 % of 220 subjects died in the validation set's study period, whereas 40 % of the 407 subjects died in the second dataset's. The validation dataset's mortality hazard ratio (HR) was 3.66 (95 % CI: 2.09-6.42) and 4.66 (CI: 2.47-8.77) for the moderate and high-risk groups. In the second dataset, Fibresolve was a predictor of mortality at initial visit, with a HR of 2.79 (1.73-4.49) and 5.82 (3.53-9.60) in the moderate and high-risk groups. Similar predictive performance was seen at follow-up visits, as well as with changes in the Fibresolve scores over sequential visits. Fibresolve predicts mortality by automatically assessing combined CT, PFTs, age, and sex into a ViT model. The new software algorithm affords accurate prognostication and demonstrates the ability to detect clinical changes over time."
"Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a devastating interstitial lung disease (ILD) characterized by progressive fibrosis and poor survival outcomes. Accurate diagnosis and prognosis remain challenging due to overlapping features with other ILDs and variability in imaging interpretation. This systematic review evaluates the current evidence on artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) applications for the diagnosis and prognosis of IPF using computed tomography (CT) imaging. Following Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines, eight studies published between 2017 and 2024 were included, demonstrating promising results across various methodologies, including deep learning (DL) models, support vector machines (SVMs), and ensemble approaches. AI-derived parameters, particularly measures of fibrotic burden and pulmonary vascular volume, consistently outperformed conventional visual CT scores for prognostication. Strong correlations between AI-quantified CT features and pulmonary function (PF) tests suggest potential surrogate markers for physiological parameters. Novel prognostic biomarkers identified through AI analysis expand understanding beyond traditional parenchymal assessment. Despite these advances, limitations include retrospective designs, sample size constraints, male-predominant cohorts, and limited external validation. Future research should prioritize large, prospective, multi-center studies with diverse populations, standardized protocols, explainable AI (XAI) techniques, and integration into clinical workflows to realize the transformative potential of AI for improving IPF management."
"Δ133p53α is a naturally occurring isoform of the tumor suppressor protein p53. Δ133p53α functions as a physiological dominant-negative inhibitor of the full-length p53 protein (commonly referred to as p53). Δ133p53α preferentially inhibits p53-mediated cellular senescence, while it does not inhibit, or may even promote, p53-mediated DNA repair. Owing to this selective inhibitory activity that preserves genome stability, Δ133p53α represents a promising target for enhancement in the prevention and treatment of diseases associated with increased senescence of normal cells. These diseases include Alzheimer's and other neurodegenerative diseases, premature aging diseases such as Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome (HGPS), and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). Current cell-based therapies, which are limited by increased cellular senescence, may also benefit from Δ133p53α-mediated improvements. As an initial application of Δ133p53α in improving therapeutic cells, we here introduce Δ133p53α-armored chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-T cells. Based on our previous and ongoing studies using various types of senescent human cells in vitro, we also discuss the importance of further exploring the therapeutic potentials of Δ133p53α, with particular focus on HGPS and IPF. The development of mouse models facilitates in vivo evaluation of the therapeutic effects of Δ133p53α, potentially leading to future clinical applications."
"Several interstitial lung diseases (ILDs) with different aetiologies and pathogenic mechanisms may exhibit a progressive behaviour, similar to idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, with comparable functional decline and early mortality. Progressive pulmonary fibrosis (PPF) is not a diagnosis but rather reflects a clinical phenotype. Identifying progression is challenging as variability exists, both between different ILDs as well as in the context of the same entity. The American Thoracic Society/European Respiratory Society guidelines provide a useful framework for recognising the progressive behaviour of individual ILDs. Nevertheless, sometimes the ""one-size-fits-all"" approach to PPF may not lead to the best management decisions for individual patients. Real-life clinical practice presents multiple hurdles for practising clinicians and it is of utmost importance to target early those individuals that will benefit from antifibrotic treatment. This review aims to highlight several clinical points and suggest that, in certain cases, the strict rule of initiating antifibrotic treatment only upon disease progression may warrant some flexibility, particularly in the context of everyday clinical practice. Emphasis is placed on critically examining the criteria used to define progression across different ILDs, commenting on clinical issues such as disease severity at baseline, prevention of acute exacerbations, the definition of ""standard treatment"", the need for early access to appropriate treatment, prediction of progression, personalised medicine and an aetiologic approach. Engaging technology and artificial intelligence will play a role in the future. Until then, the best possible management decisions will rely on the judgment of treating clinicians, guided by existing evidence and patient needs."
"Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a chronic and progressive multifactorial lung disorder characterized by excessive deposition of fibrotic connective tissue. The activation of farnesoid X receptor (FXR) and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor δ (PPARδ) demonstrated therapeutic efficacy in reducing fibrotic pathology, respectively, suggesting that dual FXR/PPARδ up-regulators may provide a prospective approach to address the polypharmacy dilemma in fibrotic diseases. Herein, the identification campaign of 6-(piperazin-1-yl)imidazo[1,2-b]pyridazine derivatives as FXR/PPARδ dual agonists was described through hybridation of FXR agonist GW-4064 and PPARδ agonist GW-0742. The following exhaustive in vitro FXR and PPARδ activation studies culminated in the optimization of compound 10g, which displayed potent dual-target activities with an FXR agonistic EC<sub>50</sub> of 12.28 nM and 69 % PPARδ activation at 100 nM. In a Bleomycin-induced murine in vivo pulmonary fibrosis model, 10g (40 mg/kg, QD) significantly attenuated collagen deposition and reduced the expression of α-SMA in lung tissue. Taken together, these results shed new light on the discovery of novel FXR/PPARδ agonists for the treatment of IPF."
"Pulmonary fibrosis, a life-threatening respiratory condition affecting millions globally, is characterized by progressive lung scarring that severely compromises respiratory function. With few effective treatment options available, it carries a poor prognosis for those affected. Disrupted iron homeostasis is increasingly implicated in its pathogenesis, yet the precise mechanisms linking iron overload to fibrotic progression remain elusive. This study unveils a novel pathway by which iron accumulation orchestrates fibrotic remodeling via secreted phosphoprotein 1 (SPP1)-mediated reprogramming of alveolar type 2 (AT2) cells. Using an integrated approach combining analysis of public single-cell and single-nucleus RNA sequencing datasets with functional validation across multiple murine models of pulmonary fibrosis (iron-induced, bleomycin-induced, and silica-induced), we demonstrate that iron overload within AT2 cells triggers a coordinated transcriptional cascade affecting iron handling, immune cell recruitment, and cellular differentiation. Mechanistically, SPP1 emerges as a key mediator, functioning both externally as a paracrine signal for macrophage recruitment following iron-induced secretion from AT2 cells and internally as a driver of pathological epithelial transitions, specifically fostering the development of a <i>Krt8</i><sup>+</sup> alveolar intermediate phenotype. The clinical relevance of these findings is substantiated by analysis of human idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis specimens using publicly available single-cell and spatial transcriptomic datasets. These analyses reveal conserved pathway activation and a distinctive spatial organization of SPP1-expressing AT2 cells within remodeled tissue microenvironments, notably in close proximity to macrophages. By establishing SPP1 as a critical nexus between iron dysregulation and fibrotic progression, our work identifies the SPP1 signaling axis as a compelling therapeutic target for this devastating condition.<b>NEW & NOTEWORTHY</b> This study reveals a novel mechanism linking iron dysregulation to pulmonary fibrosis through SPP1-mediated reprogramming of alveolar type 2 cells. We demonstrate SPP1's dual role: externally coordinating macrophage recruitment and internally directing pathological epithelial transitions toward a <i>Krt8</i><sup>+</sup> intermediate state. These findings, validated across multiple mouse models and human specimens, identify the SPP1 signaling axis as a promising therapeutic target, offering new hope for treating this devastating condition where treatment options have historically been limited."
"Extracellular Vesicles (EVs) derived from mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have gained recognition as promising therapeutic and drug delivery agents in regenerative medicine. However, their clinical application is limited by donor variability, low scalability, and inconsistent therapeutic quality. To overcome these challenges, a robust and standardized production platform is urgently needed. We developed a scalable biomanufacturing strategy by generating and expanding MSCs from extended pluripotent stem cells (EPSC) using a suspension bioreactor culture system. A fixed-bed bioreactor was integrated for automated, continuous expansion of iMSCs and downstream EV harvesting. EVs were isolated through a streamlined protocol and characterized for size, morphology, surface markers, and bioactivity. Therapeutic efficacy was assessed in a bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis mouse model. iMSC-derived EVs (iMSC-EVs) exhibited comparable characteristics to primary MSC-EVs, including a size distribution of 70-80 nm, cup-shaped morphology, and expression of canonical EV markers (CD63, CD81, TSG101). iMSCs were expanded for up to 20 days in 3D culture, yielding > 5 × 10⁸ cells per batch using a suspension bioreactor culture system and producing ~ 1.2 × 10¹³ EV particles/day in a fixed-bed bioreactor. In vivo, iMSC-EVs significantly reduced Ashcroft fibrosis scores and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid protein levels in bleomycin-injured lungs, with therapeutic efficacy comparable to primary MSC-EVs. This study establishes a scalable and standardized platform for producing high-quality iMSC-EVs using bioreactor-based systems. Our approach addresses key limitations in traditional EV production and sets the stage for AI-integrated, fully automated, GMP-compliant manufacturing of therapeutic EVs suitable for clinical translation."
"Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a degenerative pulmonary condition marked by a substantial accumulation of extracellular matrix and chronic inflammation. Matrix metalloproteinase-7 (MMP-7) is integral to fibrosis and likely a curative focus. This study investigates the therapeutic potential of Tylophora indica (T. indica) plant extract for treating IPF, utilizing in vivo and in silico approaches that target MMP-7. T. indica extract was administered to a bleomycin-induced IPF mouse model at 200 and 300 mg/kg/day doses. Efficacy was evaluated through histological analysis and quantitative RT-PCR to measure MMP-7 expression. In silico molecular dynamics simulation and molecular docking identified bioactive compounds from T. indica that could inhibit MMP-7. ADMET profiling was used to evaluate these substances' pharmacological potential and safety. T. indica extract at 300 mg/kg/day significantly reduced fibrosis and inflammation, improving histopathological scores and lowering MMP-7 expression. In silico analysis identified pergularinine, tylophorine, quercetin, kaempferol, and tylophorinidine as potent MMP-7 inhibitors with stronger binding affinities than pirfenidone, a standard anti-fibrotic drug. Molecular dynamics simulations confirmed the stability of these interactions, and the compounds showed favorable safety profiles in ADMET assessments. T. indica extract demonstrated significant antifibrotic activity by downregulating MMP-7 expression and improving lung histopathology in the IPF mouse model. The identified phytochemicals show strong potential as natural MMP-7 inhibitors, suggesting T. indica as a prospective therapeutic agent for IPF. Additional clinical studies are required to validate these results."
"Hypereosinophilic syndrome (HES) is a rare condition characterized by persistent eosinophilia (eosinophil count ≥1.5 × 10<sup>9</sup>/L) and end-organ damage in the absence of an identifiable cause. Cardiac involvement is common and may lead to life-threatening complications. Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a chronic multisystem disease predominantly associated with neutrophilic inflammation, and eosinophilic disorders are less often reported in this population. A 32-year-old woman with CF, complicated by CF-related diabetes and pancreatic insufficiency, presented with chest pain and peripheral eosinophilia (3.2 × 10⁹/L); infectious, autoimmune, and allergic evaluations were negative. Imaging revealed perimyocarditis, and systemic corticosteroids were initially effective but discontinued due to cushingoid side effects and anasarca. She subsequently experienced a recurrence of chest pain accompanied by eosinophilia (1.7 × 10⁹/L), and a diagnosis of idiopathic HES was made based on persistent eosinophilia, cardiac involvement, and exclusion of secondary causes. She responded favorably to monthly subcutaneous mepolizumab, a monoclonal antibody that prevents interleukin-5 (IL-5) from binding to its receptor, thereby inhibiting the recruitment and activation of eosinophils, with resolution of eosinophilia and improvement in symptoms. This case underscores the importance of considering HES in CF patients presenting with unexplained eosinophilia and extrapulmonary symptoms. It also illustrates the efficacy of targeted biologic therapy in managing idiopathic HES when corticosteroids are poorly tolerated."
"The integrity and stability of DNA, an essential genetic material, need to be maintained for normal cellular function, growth, and development. The DNA damage response (DDR) constitutes a complex, sophisticated, and extensive signaling network that preserves genomic stability under stress. It can be divided into the DNA damage surveillance system and DNA damage repair system, which work in concert to ensure genomic integrity. When DNA damage surpasses the repair capacity of the DDR, unrepaired DNA damage accumulates, inducing cellular senescence and altering the fate of alveolar epithelial cells; this process is intricately linked to the onset, progression, and management of developmental and chronic lung diseases. In this review, recent research on the pathogenic mechanisms of DDR in respiratory diseases across the lifespan, including bronchopulmonary dysplasia, bronchial asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, as well as progress in the development of associated targeted therapeutic strategies, is synthesized."
"Radiolabeled fibroblast activation protein inhibitors (FAPIs) have emerged as promising tracers for molecular imaging, particularly in the field of oncology. However, their potential extends beyond cancer applications to a wide range of non-oncological conditions characterized by fibrosis, inflammation, and tissue remodeling. This review addresses the expanding role of FAPI-based imaging in non-malignant diseases, related to its ability to visualize and quantify fibroblast activation, a key process in various pathological conditions. We discuss the mechanism of action of FAPIs, their radiolabeling techniques, and their pharmacokinetics and biodistribution. The review then delves into the evidence supporting the use of FAPI-PET and SPECT in specific non-oncological applications, including cardiovascular diseases (myocardial infarction, atherosclerosis, cardiomyopathies, cardiac amyloidosis, and systemic vasculitis), liver fibrosis, pulmonary fibrosis (idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis and other interstitial lung diseases), renal diseases (chronic kidney disease, lupus nephritis, and IgA nephropathy), bone and joint diseases (rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, periprosthetic joint infection, and other bone and joint pathologies), and other inflammatory conditions (Crohn's disease and IgG4-related disease). We analyze the diagnostic performance of FAPI imaging in these conditions, comparing it with conventional imaging techniques and highlighting its advantages and limitations. Finally, we discuss the challenges and future directions in the field, including the need for standardization, validation studies, and the development of quantitative imaging biomarkers to improve the clinical utility of FAPI-based imaging in non-oncological applications. The aim of this review is to provide a comprehensive overview of the current state of FAPI imaging in non-oncological diseases, highlighting its potential to improve diagnosis, treatment planning, and monitoring of these conditions."
"Inhalable nucleic acid drug delivery systems have garnered increasing attention as a promising strategy for the treatment of chronic pulmonary diseases, such as asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), cystic fibrosis (CF), and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). These diseases are often characterized by chronic inflammation, airway remodeling, and progressive lung dysfunction, posing significant clinical challenges. Nucleic acid therapeutics, including plasmid DNA, messenger RNA (mRNA), microRNA (miRNA), small interfering RNAs (siRNAs), and antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs), offer the potential to correct genetic defects, modulate aberrant gene expression, or suppress pathogenic signaling pathways. The inhalation route enables direct, non-invasive access to the lungs, offering localized delivery, rapid onset of action, and reduced systemic side effects. However, the lung presents multiple biological barriers that limit the delivery and activity of nucleic acids, including mucus clearance, enzymatic degradation, alveolar macrophage uptake, and cellular membrane penetration. To address these challenges, various delivery vectors-ranging from viral vectors to non-viral systems such as lipid nanoparticles, polymeric carriers, and hybrid nanomaterials-have been engineered to enhance stability, targeting, and transfection efficiency. This review highlights recent advances in inhalable nucleic acid delivery platforms, discusses the critical physiological and pathological barriers in the pulmonary microenvironment, and outlines current clinical progress. Finally, we explore future directions and challenges toward clinical translation of these innovative therapies. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: Chronic pulmonary diseases, including COPD, asthma, IPF, and CF, remain among the leading causes of morbidity and mortality worldwide, with limited treatment options that target disease pathogenesis at the molecular level. Nucleic acid therapeutics offer transformative potential to precisely regulate gene expression, correct mutations, and modulate inflammatory or fibrotic pathways. However, effective delivery to the lungs remains a critical barrier to clinical translation. This review highlights the emerging field of inhalable nucleic acid delivery systems, integrating recent advances in nanocarrier design, pulmonary targeting strategies, and the navigation of biological barriers. By bridging nucleic acid pharmacology with pulmonary drug delivery science, this review provides a comprehensive framework for the rational design and clinical development of next-generation genetic therapies for respiratory diseases. It also offers forward-looking perspectives on overcoming current translational hurdles, thereby accelerating the realization of precision gene therapy for chronic lung disorders."
"Telomere and telomerase abnormalities play critical roles in interstitial lung diseases (ILDs). This study aimed to explore the telomere lengths (TL) in cells in the peripheral blood and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) of healthy individuals and patient with various types of non-idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF)-ILD and to evaluate the correlation between TL and clinical indicators. We enrolled 48 patients with ILDs and 21 control individuals who presented at our hospital from September 2023 to September 2024. The relative TL of genomic deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and BALF macrophages were measured using quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). Patients with non-IPF-FILD had significantly shorter PBMC TL than controls (p < 0.001) and non-F-ILD patients (p < 0.001). There was a linear correlation between the TL in cells in the BALF and peripheral blood. Compared with control individuals, patients with non-F-ILD also had no significant difference in TL in cells both in the PBMC and BALF. TL was strongly associated with the presence of autoantibodies (η<sup>2</sup> = 0.275, p = 0.012) and the use of immunosuppressants (η<sup>2</sup> = 0.246, p = 0.010). The PBMC TL of non-IPF-FILD patients were significantly shorter than that of control and non-F-ILD patients. However, there was no significant difference in TL in cells in the BALF and peripheral blood between non-F-ILD patients and control individuals. TL were closely correlated with the presence of autoantibodies and treatment with immunosuppressants."
"Melanoma is still one of the most aggressive cancers, with global incidence and mortality rates expected to rise significantly by 2040. Surgical excision with adequate safety margins remains the standard treatment for primary cutaneous melanoma. However, the therapeutic approach to treat advanced stages or disease recurrence in melanoma is still challenging. Although initial responses to combined targeted therapies and immune checkpoint inhibitors often achieve clinical success, disease progression remains difficult to manage. Thus, there is an urgent need for novel and unexplored therapeutic strategies. Pirfenidone (PFD) is an antifibrotic drug approved for Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis, with anti-inflammatory, and anti-oxidant properties. Its primary mechanism involves Transforming Growth Factorβ signalling downregulation, alongside with the suppression of cytokine and reactive oxygen species (ROS) release. Recently, it has been suggested that PFD may function as furin convertase enzyme inhibitor. Furin is involved in many physiological and pathological processes such as BRAF oncogene activation. In this study, we investigated the mechanisms of antitumoral effect of PFD in BRAF mutated human melanoma cell lines. Docking analysis revealed a close interaction between PFD and furin convertase active site. In vitro studies revealed that PFD reduced cell proliferation, clonogenicity, and invasiveness. Interestingly, the early antioxidant effect observed during PFD treatment was later replaced by a marked increase in ROS levels, along with p21 upregulation and induction of apoptosis. This multi-angle approach highlights a key role of furin in melanoma cell aggressiveness. Although, the present study lacks clinical data from melanoma patients, our observations suggest that PFD may represent a treatment option for metastatic melanoma cases that are resistant to conventional therapeutic interventions, through a drug repurposing approach."
"Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), a progressive and fatal lung disease, is predominantly driven by oxidative stress-induced alveolar epithelial cell (AEC) senescence. However, effective therapeutic strategies for IPF remain rudimentary. Here, we demonstrate that isorhapontigenin (ISO), a compound known to mitigate oxidative damage and mitochondrial lipid peroxidation, attenuates pulmonary fibrosis by targeting peroxiredoxin 2 (PRDX2). Utilizing bleomycin-induced murine models and TGF-β-treated BEAS-2B cells, we demonstrated that ISO markedly attenuate histopathological alterations and extracellular matrix deposition associated with pulmonary fibrosis, while concurrently mitigating alveolar epithelial cell senescence. Integrative analyses combining network pharmacology and proteomics identified PRDX2 as a principal molecular target of ISO. Further molecular docking studies and drug affinity responsive target stability (DARTS) assays revealed that ISO engages PRDX2 through STAT3, establishing a key molecular bridge for their interaction. Notably, LC-MS/MS-based proteomics combined with single-cell sequencing further revealed a pronounced downregulation of PRDX2 expression in fibrotic lung tissues. Knockdown of PRDX2 exacerbated fibrotic progression, underscoring its protective role in pulmonary homeostasis. Mechanistically, ISO alleviates oxidative stress and prevents AEC senescence through PRDX2 upregulation, thereby offering a novel therapeutic strategy for IPF. These findings not only establish PRDX2 as a pivotal regulator of pulmonary fibrosis but also highlight ISO as a promising therapeutic candidate for IPF treatment."
"The prognostic utility of patient-reported outcomes (PROs) in mild to moderate fibrosing interstitial lung disease (FILD) remains insufficiently characterized. In this retrospective study, we examined the associations between PROs-Short-Form 36 (SF-36), Nagasaki University Respiratory Activities of Daily Living Questionnaire (NRADL), Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale-Depression (HADS-D) and HADS-Anxiety (HADS-A)-and progression-free survival (PFS) in patients with FILD and a gender-age-physiology (GAP) score ≤5. We employed principal component analysis (PCA), hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA), and Cox proportional hazards modeling. PFS events were defined as a >10 % decline in forced vital capacity (FVC), >15 % decline in diffusing capacity for carbon monoxide (D<sub>LCO</sub>), acute exacerbation, or death from FILD. Among 115 patients analyzed, PCA revealed that NRADL, select SF-36 subscales, and HADS-D correlated with age, gender, modified Medical Research Council scale, ILD-GAP score, FVC, D<sub>LCO</sub>, 6-min walk distance, and/or Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease Assessment Test (CAT) score. HCA-based clustering of SF-36, NRADL, and HADS-D, and HADS-A-though not individual PRO measures-was independently associated with PFS. Additional independent predictors included lowest SpO<sub>2</sub> during 6MWT, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis diagnosis, and CAT score. In patients with mild to moderate FILD, SF-36, NRADL, HADS-D, and HADS-A demonstrated associations with multiple clinical parameters. Clustering based on these PROs was significantly associated with PFS. These findings suggest that a multidimensional evaluation of health-related quality of life, activities of daily living, and mental status using PROs may offer valuable prognostic insights and support risk stratification in clinical practice."
"Activated fibroblasts are major mediators of pulmonary fibrosis. Fibroblasts are generally found in the connective tissue but upon activation can generate excess extracellular matrix (ECM) in the lung interstitial section. Therefore, fibroblasts are one of the most targeted cells for treating idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). Here, we develop an anti-fibrotic platform that can modulate both the lysophosphatidic acid receptor 1 (LPA<sub>1</sub>) and the inflammatory pathway through tumor necrosis factor <i>α</i>-induced protein 3 (TNFAIP3, also known as A20) in fibroblasts. First, we synthesized a series of LPA<sub>1</sub> antagonists, AM095 and AM966, derived amino lipids (LA lipids) which were formulated into LA-lipid nanoparticles (LA-LNPs) encapsulating mRNA. Specifically, LA5-LNPs, with AM966 head group and biodegradable acetal lipid tails, showed efficient A20 mRNA delivery to lung fibroblasts <i>in vitro</i> (80.2% ± 1.5%) and <i>ex vivo</i> (17.2% ± 0.4%). When treated to primary mouse lung fibroblasts (MLF), this formulation inhibited fibroblast migration and collagen production, thereby slowing the progression of IPF. Overall, LA5-LNPs encapsulated with A20 mRNA is a novel platform offering a potential approach to regulate fibroblast activation for the treatment of IPF."
"Pulmonary fibrosis (PF) is a fatal disease characterized by progressive fibrosis of lung tissue, with a key pathological feature of excessive accumulation of extracellular matrix. PF occurs from complicated origins, while emerging findings have suggested the involvement of the environmental factors in the risk of PF through epigenetic regulation. This article will discuss how recent advances in epigenetic alterations of DNA methylation, RNA methylation, histone modifications, and non-coding RNAs contribute to PF development through molecular mechanisms and cellular processes, including fibroblast-to-myofibroblast transition (FMT), epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), alveolar epithelial cell injury and immune cell interactions in the past 5 years."
"This study investigates how plasma exosomal miRNAs regulate core fucosylation (CF)-modified targets to influence autophagy and fibrosis in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), aiming to identify novel therapeutic strategies targeting dysregulated alveolar epithelial cell (AEC) autophagy. Plasma exosomes from IPF patients and healthy controls were isolated via ultracentrifugation, validated by TEM, nanoparticle tracking analysis (NTA), and Western blot (CD9/CD81). Exosomal miRNA profiling employed high-throughput sequencing, with TargetScan/miRanda predicting target genes. A549 and MLE-12 cells assessed exosome uptake (PKH67 labeling) and miRNA-mRNA interactions (dual-luciferase assays). CF modification was analyzed via immunoprecipitation/Western blot. In vivo validation used bleomycin (BLM)-induced fibrosis models in alveolar epithelial-specific FUT8-knockout (CKO) mice. IPF plasma exosomes suppressed autophagy and exacerbated fibrosis in AECs. miR-15a-5p was markedly downregulated in IPF exosomes. Overexpression of miR-15a-5p reversed BLM-induced autophagy inhibition and fibrosis. Mechanistically, miR-15a-5p directly targeted IGF1R, a CF-modified protein. Reduced miR-15a-5p elevated IGF1R expression, activating PI3K/AKT to inhibit autophagy and promote fibrosis. This study identifies miR-15a-5p as a critical regulator of CF-modified IGF1R in IPF pathogenesis. Its downregulation drives PI3K/AKT-mediated autophagy suppression, accelerating fibrosis. Restoring miR-15a-5p or targeting IGF1R/PI3K/AKT signaling may offer novel therapeutic avenues for IPF."
"Radiation-induced lung injury (RILI) includes early acute phase radiation pneumonitis (RP), and late chronic phase radiation-induced pulmonary fibrosis (RIPF). There is increasing evidence that ionizing radiation-induced cellular senescence is associated with pulmonary fibrosis. We have recently reported that biomarkers of senescence and, specifically, tyrosine kinase Fgr are induced in mouse RIPF, human idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), and in human RIPF. We also reported that treatment with an Fgr inhibitor significantly reduced fibrosis of irradiated mouse lungs. Here, we investigated the association of senescence and tyrosine kinase Fgr in non-human primate (NHP) lung fibrosis and determined whether lung fibrosis can be predicted by analyzing the bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) cells and fluid at early time points after irradiation. We found that markers of senescence (p16, p21) and expression of Fgr are induced in the lungs of NHP with RILI. That fibrosis can be predicted by analyzing BAL cells prior to the appearance of pulmonary fibrosis. We also induced senescence and expression of Fgr in irradiated normal human primary airway epithelial cells in vitro. In a transwell culture system, we established that senescent human airway epithelial cells induced the fibrosis biomarkers collagen1, collagen 3, and alpha-smooth-muscle actin in target human primary lung fibroblasts. Whole-thorax lung irradiated (WTLI) NHPs in this study developed moderate to severe pneumonitis and marked variations in the magnitude of RIPF as measured by trichrome staining. In BAL fluid that was collected from WTLI NHP, senescence-associated secretory proteins (SASP) were significantly induced, compared to the BAL fluid collected from control non-irradiated NHPs. Moreover, the levels of Fgr and biomarkers of senescence were significantly higher in NHPs with severely injured lungs compared to those with mildly or moderately injured lungs as indicated by fibrosis. Proinflammatory SASP cytokines increased to levels that correlated with the severity of RILI. The results show that senescent cells with induction of Fgr, and SASP cytokines are detectable in NHPs prior to RIPF and suggest that analysis of these proteins can predict the severity of RIPF prior to fully formed fibrosis."
"Predicting shorter life expectancy is crucial for prioritizing antifibrotic therapy in fibrotic lung diseases, where progression varies widely, from stability to rapid deterioration. This heterogeneity complicates treatment decisions, emphasizing the need for reliable baseline measures. This study focuses on leveraging artificial intelligence model to address heterogeneity in disease outcomes, focusing on mortality as the ultimate measure of disease trajectory. This retrospective study included 1744 anonymised patients who underwent high-resolution CT scanning. The AI model, SABRE (Smart Airway Biomarker Recognition Engine), was developed using data from patients with various lung diseases (n=460, including lung cancer, pneumonia, emphysema, and fibrosis). Then, 1284 high-resolution CT scans with evidence of diffuse FLD from the Australian IPF Registry and OSIC were used for clinical analyses. Airway branches were categorized and quantified by anatomic structures and volumes, followed by multivariable analysis to explore the associations between these categories and patients' progression and mortality, adjusting for disease severity or traditional measurements. Cox regression identified SABRE-based variables as independent predictors of mortality and progression, even adjusting for disease severity (fibrosis extent, traction bronchiectasis extent, and ILD extent), traditional measures (FVC%, DLCO%, and CPI), and previously reported deep learning algorithms for fibrosis quantification and morphological analysis. Combining SABRE with DLCO significantly improved prognosis utility, yielding an AUC of 0.852 at the first year and a C-index of 0.752. SABRE-based variables capture prognostic signals beyond that provided by traditional measurements, disease severity scores, and established AI-based methods, reflecting the progressiveness and pathogenesis of the disease."
"Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a progressive, life-threatening interstitial lung disease whose pathogenesis remains unclear. There is evidence showing the possible role of CD8+ T cells in the pathogenesis of IPF and the correlation with the clinical symptoms of IPF. In order to further explore the role of CD8+ T cells in IPF, we screened CD8+ T cell related genes (CRG) that are associated with IPF prognosis, and established the molecular typing characteristics of IPF. Subsequently, CXCR4, GPR56 and PAK1 were screened as independent prognostic factors. Expression profiles and multivariate analysis coefficients were used to establish and validate prognostic features of IPF. Immuno-infiltration characteristics of the established feature were also analyzed. Subsequent in vitro experiments verified the abnormal expressions of three independent prognostic factors in TGF-β1 treated IPF model at protein and mRNA levels. Our findings shed new light on the important role of CD8+ T cells in the pathogenesis of IPF and provide potential targets for predicting prognosis and possible future clinical applications."
"Autotaxin (ATX) plays a critical role in exacerbating inflammation and fibrosis, making it a promising target for fibrosis treatment. Herein, in pursuit of expanding the chemical space of novel ATX inhibitors, a series of imidazole-fused (imidazo[1,2-b]pyridazine and benzo[d]imidazole) derivatives with aliphatic amine linkers were designed through integrating the structural features of GLPG-1690 and PF-8380. Meanwhile, a terminal aromatic benzamide fragment was involved to penetrate the hydrophobic pocket. Following enzyme activity screening, compound 12 bearing N-(1H-benzo[d]imidazole-5-yl)furan-2-carboxamide showed the optimal in vitro ATX inhibitory activity (IC<sub>50</sub> = 46 nM), accompanied by favorable drug-like properties. The docking study well elucidated the promising activity of 12 for the key H-bond interactions with Trp261 and Ser170, as well as π-π interactions with Trp255 and Phe274. Significantly, in the Bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis mouse model, 12 has certainly reduced collagen deposition and ameliorated lung fibrosis. Overall, compound 12 turned out to be a well-characterized potent ATX inhibitor warranting further investigation for the treatment of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis."
"The genetic contribution to idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) has become increasingly evident, enabling its translation into clinical practice. MUC5B rs35705950 has emerged as a promising prognostic biomarker. The gender-age-physiology (GAP)-model is regularly used for IPF survival prediction. In this retrospective real-world study, GAP-stages were stratified by MUC5B T-allele carriage. European patients with IPF were included in a discovery (n = 663), and replication (n = 738) cohort. The GAP+MUC5B-model was significantly more accurate compared to the GAP-model (all cohorts p < 0.001), with a modest improvement in discrimination (ΔC = 0.023; C = 0.685, 95%CI 0.665-0.704). Within each GAP-stage, T-allele carriers had significantly better median transplant-free survival outcomes than non-carriers (p < 0.001): In the combined cohort (n = 1401) survival for GAP-stage I T carriers was 70 months (m) vs 48m for T non-carriers; stage II T vs non-T: 41 vs 31m; stage III T vs non-T: 23 vs 12m. Addition of MUC5B rs35705950 T-carriership enhances GAP-based prognostication and aids clinical decision-making."
"<i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PA)</i> causes severe respiratory infections utilizing multiple virulence functions. Previous findings on the PA secreted quorum sensing (QS)-regulated small molecule, 2'-aminoacetophenone (2-AA), revealed its impact on immune and metabolic functions, favouring a long-term presence of PA in the host. However, the 2-AA's specific effects on bronchial-airway epithelium and pulmonary endothelium remain elusive. To evaluate the spatiotemporal changes in 2AA within the human airway, considering endothelial cells as the primary point of contact when the route of lung infection is hematogenic, we utilized the airway-on-achip platform. This dynamic culture system recapitulates critical elements of the human airway microphysiological environment. We utilized the microfluidic airway-on-chip platform, lined by polarized primary human pulmonary microvascular endothelial cells (HPMEC) and adjacent primary normal human bronchial epithelial cells (NHBE) obtained from healthy female donors. Cells exposed to 2-AA (20 μm) through continuous flow for 12 hours were used for whole-genome RNA sequencing and analyzed for their responses and potential cross-talk. Transcriptome findings were validated through <i>in vivo</i> studies in mice and additional cell culture experiments. Analyses revealed that 2-AA differentially regulates specific signaling and biosynthesis pathways in epithelial cells, including HIF-1 and pyrimidine signaling, glycosaminoglycan and glycosphingolipid biosynthesis. In endothelial cells, fatty acid metabolism, phosphatidylinositol, and estrogen receptor signaling, as well as proinflammatory signaling pathways, were identified. Significant overlap was found in both cell types in response to 2-AA in genes implicated in immune response and cellular functions. In contrast, we found that genes related to barrier permeability, cholesterol metabolism, and oxidative phosphorylation were differentially regulated in response to 2-AA exposure in the studied cell types. Murine <i>in vivo</i> and additional <i>in vitro</i> cell culture studies confirmed the accumulation of cholesterol in epithelial cells. Results also revealed that specific biomarkers associated with cystic fibrosis and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis were modulated by 2-AA in both cell types, with the expression of cystic fibrosis transmembrane regulator being affected only in endothelial cells."
"Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common sustained arrhythmia and is linked to increased risk of stroke, heart failure, and mortality. Circulating extracellular RNAs (exRNAs), which regulate gene expression and reflect underlying biological processes, are potential biomarkers for atrial fibrillation. As part of an ongoing, larger study into extracellular RNAs (exRNAs) as potential biomarkers for cardiovascular disease, we analyzed exRNA profiles in a subset of 296 survivors of acute coronary syndrome (ACS) enrolled in the Transitions, Risks, and Actions in Coronary Events Center for Outcomes Research and Education (TRACE-CORE) cohort. A total of 318 exRNAs were quantified, selected <i>a priori</i> based on prior findings from the Framingham Heart Study. We assessed associations between circulating exRNAs and echocardiographic intermediate phenotypes relevant to atrial fibrillation (AF), including left atrial dimension, left ventricular (LV) mass, LV end-diastolic volume, and global longitudinal strain. Subsequently, we used logistic regression models to evaluate whether the exRNAs associated with these phenotypes were also associated with a history of AF (<i>n</i> = 18, 5.4%). Downstream bioinformatics analyses were performed to identify putative target genes, enriched gene ontology categories, and molecular pathways regulated by these candidate microRNAs. We identified 77 extracellular RNAs (exRNAs) that were significantly associated with increased left ventricular (LV) mass and at least one additional echocardiographic intermediate phenotype. Among these, miR-17-5p and miR-574-3p were also significantly associated with a history of atrial fibrillation (AF), with odds ratios of 1.58 (95% CI: 1.10-2.26) and 2.16 (95% CI: 1.03-4.54), respectively. Predicted gene targets of these miRNAs were enriched in pathways implicated in atrial remodeling and arrhythmogenesis. Key overlapping canonical pathways included the Senescence Pathway, Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis Signaling, ERK5 Signaling, RHO GTPase Cycle, and HGF Signaling. Circulating exRNAs, including miR-17-5p and miR-574-3p, are associated with cardiac remodeling and a history of AF in ACS survivors. These findings highlight their potential as biomarkers of atrial remodeling and implicate key molecular pathways involved in AF pathogenesis."
"<i>Background and Objectives</i>: Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a specific form of chronic, progressive interstitial lung disease with an unknown etiology. It is often accompanied by skeletal muscle mass loss. Chest wall muscles play a crucial role in respiratory movements and form part of the skeletal muscles. The aim of this study is to evaluate the relationship between chest wall muscle thickness and pulmonary function test (PFT) results, as well as other prognostic markers, in patients with IPF. <i>Materials and Methods</i>: A retrospective analysis was conducted on 108 patients diagnosed with IPF and 53 control subjects. Chest wall muscle thickness was measured on thoracic computed tomography (CT) images at specific anatomical levels. PFT parameters, the Gender-Age-Physiology (GAP) index, number of acute exacerbations, and mortality data were evaluated in relation to muscle thickness. <i>Results</i>: IPF patients had significantly reduced thickness in the bilateral external scapular muscles at both the aortic and pulmonary trunk levels compared to controls. Bilateral pectoral muscle thickness at the aortic level was positively correlated with forced vital capacity (FVC) and negatively correlated with the number of exacerbations. Internal scapular muscle thickness at the aortic level showed a significant positive correlation with diffusion capacity of the lung for carbon monoxide (DLCO) and a negative correlation with both GAP scores and exacerbation frequency. External scapular muscle thickness at the pulmonary trunk level was positively associated with PFT parameters and inversely correlated with the GAP index, exacerbations, and mortality. <i>Conclusions</i>: In patients with IPF, the bilateral external scapular muscle thickness at the aortic and pulmonary trunk levels was significantly reduced compared to controls. Significant associations were found between some chest wall muscle thicknesses and the GAP index, pulmonary function, acute exacerbations, and mortality, underscoring the prognostic value of baseline muscle measurements. Measurement of chest wall muscle thickness using routine thoracic CT scans may offer additional prognostic value in IPF. Incorporating this parameter into clinical evaluation may help identify patients who could benefit from supportive interventions, such as nutritional therapy or pulmonary rehabilitation."
"<i>Background and Objectives</i>: Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a progressive and fatal interstitial lung disease with limited therapeutic options. Current therapies (pirfenidone, nintedanib) exhibit modest efficacy and significant side effects, underscoring the need for novel strategies targeting early pathogenic drivers. Saroglitazar (SGZ), a dual PPARα/γ agonist with anti-inflammatory properties approved for diabetic dyslipidemia, has not been explored for IPF. We aimed to investigate SGZ's therapeutic potential in pulmonary fibrosis and elucidate its mechanisms of action. <i>Materials and Methods</i>: Using a bleomycin (BLM)-induced murine pulmonary fibrosis model, we administered SGZ therapeutically. A histopathological assessment (H&E, Masson's trichrome, collagen I immunofluorescence), Western blotting, and qRT-PCR analyzed the fibrosis progression and inflammatory markers. Flow cytometry evaluated the macrophage polarization. In vitro studies used RAW264.7 macrophages stimulated with BLM/LPS and MRC-5 fibroblast co-cultures. The NF-κB/NLRP3 pathway activation was assessed through protein and gene expression. <i>Results</i>: SGZ significantly attenuated BLM-induced histopathological hallmarks, including alveolar wall thickening, collagen deposition, and inflammatory infiltration. Fibrotic markers (OPN, α-SMA) and pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-1β, TNF-α, IL-6) were downregulated in the SGZ-treated mice. Mechanistically, SGZ suppressed the M1 macrophage polarization (reduced CD86<sup>+</sup> populations) and inhibited the NF-κB/NLRP3 pathway activation in the alveolar macrophages. In the RAW264.7 cells, SGZ decreased the NLRP3 inflammasome components (ASC, cleaved IL-1β) and cytokine secretion. Co-cultures demonstrated that the SGZ-treated macrophage supernatants suppressed the fibroblast activation (α-SMA, collagen I) in MRC-5 cells. <i>Conclusions</i>: SGZ attenuates pulmonary fibrosis by suppressing macrophage-driven inflammation via NF-κB/NLRP3 inhibition and disrupting the macrophage-fibroblast crosstalk. These findings nominate SGZ as a promising candidate for preclinical optimization and future clinical evaluation in IPF."
"The neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) is a simple, inexpensive and easily accessible inflammatory biomarker that reflects the balance between innate and adaptive immunity. In recent years, NLR has emerged as a potential prognostic and disease severity marker for different diseases, including idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), a progressive and fatal interstitial lung disease with a highly variable course and poor prognosis. Several studies have highlighted that NLR can be associated with several clinical outcomes such as lung function decline, increased risk of hospitalization, acute exacerbation of IPF, and mortality over time. It might also correlate with overall survival in the course of antifibrotic therapy and validated prognostic score as a gender-age-physiology score. Despite these findings, the clinical use of NLR remains limited due to its non-specific nature, the lack of standardized cut-off values, and high variability related to demographic factors, comorbidities and medications. Hence, NLR may display the underlying immune dysregulation in IPF and could be exploited as a non-invasive tool for risk stratification and disease monitoring. Further studies are needed to confirm and validate its use in IPF and to establish reliable cut-off values in clinical applications."
"Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a progressive fibrotic condition. Serial FVC monitoring is most commonly used to assess progression of disease but FVC does not always reflect regional CT change in IPF. Recently there has been growing interest in quantitative CT (qCT) assessment of IPF. In this study, we compared different physiological and qCT measurements of disease progression in predicting mortality in IPF. We question if a composite measure of disease progression using qCT and FVC is more predictive of mortality than individual measurements, and if addition of blood leukocyte levels further enhance predictive ability of these measurements of disease progression. We conducted a retrospective analysis of an IPF cohort (n = 71). Annualised change (∆) in CT-measured lung volume (CTvol) and total lung fibrosis score (TLF) were calculated (using the computer software CALIPER) together with annualised change in FVC and blood leukocyte levels within 4 months of first CT. These were modelled against mortality using multivariate Cox regression. Concordance indexes (C-statistic) of different Cox regression models were used to determine the most predictive and discriminative combination for mortality. 65 cases (91.5%) were male. Median (IQR) age 73.6 years (68.4-79.3). Death was reported in 24 cases (33.8%). The median annualised change in (∆)FVC was - 4.4% (-9.6-0.0), ∆TLF; + 2.9% (0.2-7.0), and ∆CTvol; -4.3% (0.0-10.9). Combined measurements of disease progression (∆CTvol, ∆FVC and ∆TLF%) out-performed single-variable measurements in predicting all-cause mortality in IPF. The composite variable of [ΔFVC >10%, ΔCTvol >10% or ΔTLF% >10%] was most predictive of mortality [HR 7.14 (2.45-20.79), p <0.001]. Inclusion of blood leukocytes improved C-statistic scores for each multivariate model. Composite end points of ∆CTvol, ∆FVC and ∆TLF% were more predictive of mortality than single-variable measurements in this cohort. Inclusion of blood leukocytes into risk stratification models further improved mortality prediction for all measures of disease progression."
"Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a chronic, progressive, interstitial lung disease lacking efficient drug to reverse it. Thus, to elucidate the complex pathogenesis of IPF and identify new therapeutic targets are urgently needed. It has been revealed that the pathophysiology of IPF is a highly orchestrated process including multiple cell types, where the contribution of endothelial cells (ECs) has also been attracted researchers' attention. However, although the involvement of ECs in fibrosis has been recognized, the underlying key molecules driving these changes are not well-defined. Here, we revealed that von Willebrand factor (VWF), a marker of damaged ECs, and endothelial dysfunction are positively correlated with IPF progression based on reanalysis of gene expression profiles of patients with IPF. Next, we discovered that <i>VWF</i> deficiency attenuated fibrosis in experimental models, including human cell lines (<i>in vitro</i>) and mice (<i>in vivo</i>). Mechanistically, <i>VWF</i> deficiency inhibited endothelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EndoMT), regulated vascular abnormalities and limited M2 macrophage infiltration, which were achieved, at least in part, by the inhibition of Wnt signaling. Our findings provided evidence for the pivotal role of ECs in IPF and revealed VWF might be a driving factor of EndoMT, suggesting that VWF can develop as a potential therapeutic target against IPF.

"Identifying molecular biomarkers of pulmonary fibrosis (PF) would improve monitoring the disease progression and response to treatment. Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome (HPS) PF is an inherited type of progressive PF with accelerated onset of PF in patients with HPS type 1 (HPS-1). HPSPF could serve as a model to study biomarkers of progressive PF, given that all HPS-1 subjects eventually develop HPSPF. We utilized a multi-omics strategy to discover progressive blood biomarkers that can recognize factors contributing to the fibrotic cascade in the lungs of HPS subjects. Metabolomic and cytokine/chemokine profiling were performed on serum samples from patients with HPS-1, HPS-1 with PF (HPSPF), HPS-3 or HPS-5, idiopathic PF (IPF), and normal volunteers. Metabolomics, cytokine/chemokine, pulmonary function, and age data from HPS-1 and HPSPF subjects were integrated into a multi-omics network. The analysis highlighted alterations in the transsulfuration pathway, arginine metabolism, and redox balance with the progression of PF in HPS-1. Among those, CCL22 and choline were significantly elevated in HPSPF compared to HPS-1 in two independent cohorts together with age and associated with decline of pulmonary function. In ROC curve analysis, both CCL22 and choline demonstrated high accuracy in predicting PF in HPS-1 subjects, could serve as prognostic blood biomarkers of HPSPF. We noted similarity in molecular signatures of CCL22 in progressive IPF and HPSPF. We found that inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) is an upstream regulator of releasing profibrotic mediators (CCL22, CCL24, IL-18, IL1α, IL1β), suggesting therapeutic potential of iNOS inhibition in progressive HPSPF."
"Current anti-fibrotic therapeutics for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) slow disease progression but are non-curative and have systemic side effects, promoting interest in therapies that can repolarize macrophages away from their pro-fibrotic phenotype. While yeast beta-glucan (YBG) offers therapeutic potential in reprogramming macrophages toward an anti-fibrotic phenotype, YBG processing must be optimized to promote inhalability while preserving its biological activity. Herein, the biological and inhalation performance of YBG processed via Pressurized Gas eXpanded liquids technology (PGX<sup>TEC</sup>-YBG) relative to conventionally spray-dried YBG (SD-YBG) is compared. The significantly smaller size and lower density of PGX<sup>TEC</sup>-YBG relative to SD-YBG result in a smaller aerodynamic diameter (3-4 µm) and double the fine particle fraction in cascade impaction studies, variables correlated with improved inhalability and thus deposition in the distal regions of the lung. Correspondingly, PGX<sup>TEC</sup>-YBG shows an approximately double phagocytic index in vitro and enhanced suppression of CD206 expression and arginase-1 activity, lower levels of macrophage stress, and comparable capacity for promoting pro-inflammatory cytokine release in ex vivo murine precision cut lung slices relative to SD-YBG. These findings highlight PGX<sup>TEC</sup>-YBG's utility as a promising inhalable therapeutic that can offer improved delivery to the disease site while maintaining strong biological anti-fibrotic effects and reduced systemic toxicity."
"Pulmonary fibrosis is characterized by scarring and thickening of the lung parenchyma due to excessive deposition of collagen and other extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins. This leads to disruption of gas exchange areas and ultimately respiratory failure, a pathology shared across multiple interstitial lung diseases (ILDs). Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a chronic and progressive ILD characterized by exertional dyspnea, dry cough, and restrictive lung defects. Clinical progression is marked by worsening lung function, declining exercise tolerance, and hypoxemia. High-resolution computed tomography in IPF typically shows reticular opacities and honeycombing, predominantly distributed in the subpleural regions and lower lobes of the lungs. The disease course is variable, with episodes of acute exacerbation associated with high mortality. Myofibroblasts and fibroblasts are central drivers of fibrogenesis through uncontrolled proliferation, migration, survival, senescence, myofibroblast differentiation, and ECM production. Myofibroblasts represent a heterogeneous population in both origin and function, arising from diverse precursor cells, including lung resident fibroblasts, endothelial cells, and mesothelial cells, and are shaped by tissue-specific niches. Persistent activation of (myo)fibroblasts is sustained by a complex network of profibrotic growth factors and their downstream transcriptional regulators. In this review, we comprehensively examine the cellular origins and molecular pathways underlying fibroblast activation, with an emphasis on mechanistic insights that may inform the development of targeted antifibrotic therapies to attenuate disease progression and improve patient outcomes."
"Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a chronic, progressive interstitial lung disease of unknown etiology. It has been demonstrated in European, American, and Asian populations that genetic factors, particularly the MUC5B rs35705950 SNP, represent a significant risk factor for the development of this disease. To date, no studies have been performed within African populations, thereby necessitating the execution of the present investigation. Methods<i>:</i> A case-control study was conducted from September 2021 to May 2024. It included 55 patients diagnosed with IPF and 61 control subjects. Comprehensive demographic, clinical, radiological, functional, and therapeutic data were collected. Additionally, genetic analysis for the MUC5B rs35705950 SNP was carried out in the genetic department of the University Hospital Hassan II of Fez (Morocco). Results<i>:</i> The patient cohort predominantly consisted of men, with a sex ratio of 49 men to six women. The mean age was 67.72 ± 6.406 years. Of the subjects, 58.2% were former smokers. Dyspnea was the most prevalent symptom (89.1%). Radiological assessments revealed that 70.9% of patients exhibited definite usual interstitial pneumonia. The median survival time was recorded at 4.75 years. Statistical analysis indicated a significant association between the MUC5B rs35705950 SNP and IPF (p = 0.0001). Conclusions<i>:</i> This study confirms that the MUC5B rs35705950 SNP is a major risk factor for IPF within the African population. It represents the first investigation of its kind on the African continent, with the hope that it will motivate further research efforts in Africa to yield more representative data."
"Acute exacerbation of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (AE-IPF) critically affects patient survival. This study aimed to determine whether an early treatment response could accurately predict prognostic outcomes in patients with AE-IPF. This retrospective cohort study conducted at Kobe City Medical Centre General Hospital analysed 100 patients with AE-IPF treated with steroid pulse therapy during January 2012-December 2021. The initiation day was defined as Day 1. Patients were classified into Responder or Non-Responder groups based on the changes in peripheral capillary oxygen saturation/fraction of inspired oxygen (S/F) ratios from Days 1-4. The primary outcome was 28-day mortality. Cox proportional hazards models assessed the association between 28-day mortality and potential prognostic factors, including age, KL-6 levels, S/F ratios on Day 1, and Responder group status. The study cohort included 60 and 40 patients in the Responder and Non-Responder groups, respectively. The Responder group has significantly higher median IgG levels (1519 mg/dL vs. 1014 mg/dL) and lower mortality rates (12 % vs. 42.5 % at 28 days). On Day 1, the S/F ratios were comparable between the two groups. Similarly, age and levels of Krebs von den Lungen-6 also showed no significant differences. Multivariable Cox proportional hazards analysis revealed that higher initial S/F ratios (HR: 0.18, 95 % CI: 0.06-0.52) and classification in the Responder group (HR: 0.22, 95 % CI: 0.10-0.53) were associated with lower 28-day mortality. Early improvements in S/F ratios may indicate improved survival in patients with AE-IPF, suggesting their potential importance in early therapeutic decisions."
"Accumulating evidence suggests that abnormalities in airway epithelial cells involve in the development of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). However, whether ciliary impairment contributes to IPF pathogenesis is unspecified. In this study, we evaluated the ciliogenesis potency of IPF-derived small airway epithelial cells (SAECs), assessed the effect of aberrant ciliogenesis on lung fibroblast activation and further identified whether improving ciliogenesis could attenuate pulmonary fibrosis. Here, we showed that upon external injury or serial cell passage, IPF-derived SAECs had greater decline in ciliogenesis potency as compared to healthy control (HC). Conditioned medium harvested from SAECs post injury, serial passage or silencing the ciliogenesis regulator FOXJ1 promoted the expression of α-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA) and fibronectin (FN) in human lung fibroblasts as compared to their corresponding controls. Mice with bleomycin (BLM)-induced lung fibrosis had reduced number of ciliated cells as compared to the saline control, while overexpressing Foxj1 in mouse lung attenuated the extent of pulmonary fibrosis. LY450139, a γ-secretase inhibitor, could also improve ciliogenesis in IPF-derived SAECs and inhibit lung fibroblast activation induced by ciliogenesis impairment. We demonstrated the contributing role of ciliogenesis impairment in IPF pathogenesis. Targeting the ciliogenesis abnormality may be a potential therapeutic strategy for IPF."
"Chronic lung diseases such as COPD, asthma, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) and pulmonary hypertension are characterised by aberrant remodelling and degradation of the extracellular matrix. This is particularly evident within the basement membrane. Collagen IV, a major component of the basement membrane, is essential for maintaining structural support and regulating cell behaviour. However, disruptions in collagen IV metabolism and basement membrane integrity have been implicated in the pathogenesis of chronic lung diseases, especially in ageing populations where basement membrane turnover is compromised. Cleavage of collagen IV during basement membrane remodelling generates bioactive fragments known as matrikines, which serve as markers of tissue remodelling and potential diagnostic biomarkers. Despite the prominence of collagen IV in the basement membrane, its role in chronic lung diseases remains understudied compared to other collagen types. This review provides a comprehensive exploration of the roles of basement membrane collagen IV and its matrikines in COPD, asthma, IPF and pulmonary hypertension, emphasising their significance beyond classical matrix components. Through an analysis of clinical studies, animal models and <i>in vitro</i> experiments, the contributions of collagen IV to disease pathogenesis and progression are discussed. Furthermore, potential diagnostic and therapeutic implications of targeting collagen IV are outlined. By providing insights into the relationship between collagen IV and chronic lung diseases, this review aims to guide future research and clinical interventions in the field."
"To investigate the prognostic value of the HALP (Hemoglobin, Albumin, Lymphocyte, and Platelet) score for mortality in patients with Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis (IPF). From November 2020, 39 patients with IPF were followed for a duration of 3 years. At the end of 3 years, the relationship between the initial HALP score and mortality was investigated. Thirty-nine patients diagnosed with IPF were included in the study, 30 of whom were male. The average age of all patients was 68.79±7.08. At the end of the three-year follow-up period, 12 patients (33.3%) had died. When comparing patients who died and those who survived at the end of three years; significant differences were found in age, neutrophil, albumin, HALP score, FEV1%, FVC%, DLCO%, GAP score, and 6 MWD. ROC analysis for the HALP score's predictive value for mortality yielded an AUC of 0.743 and p=0.011. For a cut-off value of HALP≤30.5, p=0.01, sensitivity and specificity were 61.54% and 92.31%, respectively. Multivariate analysis for predicting mortality found HALP≤30.50 as a significant risk factor (p=0.046). An increase of one monad at the HALP cut-off (≤30.50) score level reduced the risk of death by 9.57 times. It was observed that FVC%, DLCO% and 6 MWD were not risk factors in predicting mortality. (p=0.30, p=0.08, p=0.07). Our study suggests that the HALP score may serve as a negative prognostic biomarker that can be used to predict mortality in cases with IPF."
"Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a progressive, life-threatening lung disease characterized by excessive extracellular matrix (ECM) deposition, fibroblast proliferation, and epithelial injury. Disease progression involves key signaling pathways-TGF-β, WNT/β-catenin, PI3K/AKT, and YAP/TAZ-that drive fibroblast activation, epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), endothelial-mesenchymal transition (EndMT), and ECM remodeling. Recent studies have highlighted the role of small extracellular vesicles (sEVs), particularly exosomes, as crucial modulators of the fibrotic microenvironment. These vesicles carry microRNAs (miRNAs), proteins, and lipids that influence fibroblast behaviour, immune signaling, and tissue architecture.Growing evidence supports the therapeutic promise of exosomes and engineered nanoparticle-exosome hybrids in targeting dysregulated fibrotic pathways and promoting tissue repair. This review examines the molecular mechanisms underlying pulmonary fibrosis, focusing on the role of exosomal crosstalk and therapeutic potential. We also incorporate emerging insights from single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) on fibroblast heterogeneity, the influence of senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP) on exosomal cargo, and the limitations of current animal models in recapitulating chronic IPF. Understanding these mechanisms may facilitate the development of precision medicine approaches for managing and potentially reversing IPF progression."
"Stem cell-based therapy has emerged as a promising avenue for treating pulmonary degenerative disorders due to its remarkable capacity for self-renewal and differentiation into various cell types. However, concerns regarding undesired differentiation and tumorigenicity have raised questions about the safety and efficacy of cell-based therapy. The aim of the present systematic review study was to determine the therapeutic effectiveness of stem cell secretome in mitigating three pulmonary degenerative diseases, including Acute Lung Injury (ALI), Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis (IPF), and Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia (BPD). A comprehensive search was carried out on international databases, including MEDLINE, Scopus, Web of Science, PubMed, and Embase, using related keywords according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA-2020) guidelines. Of 1541 retrieved studies, 136 articles were included in the present systematic review. The therapeutic effects of stem cells are primarily attributed to their paracrine secretions, specifically bioactive molecules known as the secretome, which includes exosomes and extracellular vesicles. Secretome-based therapy shows great promise in maximizing the healing potential of stem cells. However, several challenges and limitations hinder its widespread application, including scalability issues, delivery challenges, difficulty in controlling dosage, and the lack of standardized production protocols. As it is a novel therapeutic approach, its complex composition, mechanism of action, and variability in responses from the body, as well as long-term safety, remain unknown and pose challenges that necessitate further investigation and well-designed clinical trials. The secretome exerts its protective and therapeutic effects by regulating various processes, including inflammation, oxidative stress, cell apoptosis, macrophage polarization, growth factor signaling pathways, immune cell activation, TGF-β signaling pathways, angiogenesis, structural attenuation, fibrosis resolution, pulmonary functional improvement, and alveolarization."
"The lungs are constantly exposed to airborne pathogens and depend on robust innate immune surveillance for protection. The cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS)-stimulator of interferon genes (STING) signaling pathway, a core component of the innate immune system, plays a pivotal role in defending against respiratory infections caused by viruses, bacteria, and mycobacteria, including <i>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</i>. Dysregulation of this pathway has been linked to several chronic lung diseases, such as cystic fibrosis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, and asthma. Upon sensing cytoplasmic DNA, cGAS activates the STING pathway, producing type I interferons and pro-inflammatory cytokines that drive host immune response. However, many pathogens have developed strategies to evade detection or surpass cGAS-STING signaling. This systematic review highlights the molecular mechanisms governing cGAS-STING activation, its interaction with lung pathogens, and its potential as a therapeutic agent in respiratory diseases."
"Pulmonary fibrosis (PF) is a terminal-stage lung change in interstitial lung disease. It is characterized by proliferation of fibroblasts and deposition of a large amount of extracellular matrix, accompanied by inflammatory damage and structural destruction, caused by various reasons. The prognosis of PF is poor, and the average survival time after diagnosis is 2.5-3.5 years. The pathogenesis of PF is not yet fully understood. Its main mechanisms are diverse and include damage to alveolar epithelial cells, aggregation and activation of inflammatory cells and chemokines, proliferation of fibroblasts, transformation of myofibroblasts, production and deposition of large amounts of collagen, autophagy, epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), mitochondrial quality-control disorders, microRNA, and circular RNA. The diagnosis of PF is mainly based on the comprehensive evaluation of clinical manifestations, imaging characteristics, and histopathological examination. Medical and family history to determine all potential causes of PF. For PF of unknown etiology, one can refer to the Official Clinical Practice Guideline of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) for definitive diagnosis. In terms of treatment, modern medications such as pirfenidone and nintedanib can inhibit the progression of PF to some extent and improve lung function. However, there is no drug that can significantly improve PF, except for lung transplantation. In addition, many patients are forced to stop taking medication due to adverse reactions in clinical practice. Therefore, to better control the progression of disease, some new drugs have been developed based on the pathogenesis of PF. However, there is still controversy over their efficacy and widespread clinical application in PF, and the evidence is limited. The results of in vitro and in vivo experiments, as well as randomized clinical trials, indicate that traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) can improve PF by intervening in multiple pathways and targets. This study combines the pathogenesis and diagnosis of PF, focusing on the intervention mechanism and targets of TCM in the treatment of PF, so as to provide more options for clinical treatment and provide scientific basis for a new approach to better management of PF."
"Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a fatal condition associated with excessive interstitial collagen accumulation and irreversible lung function decline, for which there is no effective cure. Hence, this study evaluated the dose-dependent anti-fibrotic effects of bone marrow mesenchymal stem cell-derived extracellular vesicles (BM-MSC-EVs) in transforming growth factor (TGF)-β1-stimulated human dermal myofibroblasts (1 ×10<sup>7</sup>-1 ×10<sup>10</sup> BM-MSC-EVs) and TGF-β1-stimulated lung myofibroblasts isolated from non-IPF versus and IPF patients (1 ×10<sup>6</sup>-1 ×10<sup>8</sup> BM-MSC-EVs) after 72 h in culture; and when intranasally-administered therapeutically (from days 21-28 post-injury) to bleomycin (BLM)-injured mice (2.5 ×10<sup>8</sup>-2.5 ×10<sup>10</sup> BM-MSC-EVs). In each case, changes in myofibroblast differentiation, collagen I deposition, matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-2, MMP-9, tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase (TIMP)-1 and TIMP-2 levels, and MMP-2:TIMP-2 and MMP-9:TIMP-1 ratios were assessed. BM-MSC-EVs significantly attenuated human dermal and non-IPF patient-derived lung myofibroblast differentiation and collagen I deposition in an inverse dose-dependent manner after 72 h, with the lowest doses evaluated inducing the strongest inhibitory effects. Similarly, BM-MSC-EVs therapeutically reduced the BLM-induced lung TGF-β1 expression and signal transduction, myofibroblast differentiation and collagen I deposition, and restored the BLM-induced loss of dynamic lung compliance in an inverse dose-dependent manner in vivo, after 7-days of treatment. BM-MSC-EVs promoted the MMP-2:TIMP-2 ratio in human dermal myofibroblasts or the MMP-9:TIMP-1 ratio in human lung myofibroblasts and the murine lung as part of their anti-fibrotic effects. Notably, BM-MSC-EVs failed to exert any anti-fibrotic effects in TGF-β1-stimulated lung myofibroblasts isolated from IPF patients. These findings suggested that BM-MSC-EVs may provide an anti-fibrotic treatment option for early-to-moderate IPF, but may not be effective against advanced IPF."
"Small animal models are crucial for investigating idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) and developing preclinical therapeutic strategies. However, there are several limitations to the quantitative measurements used in the longitudinal assessment of experimental lung fibrosis, e.g., histological or biochemical analyses introduce interindividual variability, whereas image-derived biomarker has yet to directly and accurately quantify the severity of lung fibrosis. This study investigates artificial intelligence (AI)-assisted, end-to-end, semiquantitative measurement of lung fibrosis using in vivo micro-computed tomography (CT). Based on the bleomycin (BLM)-induced lung fibrosis mouse model, the AI model predicts histopathological scores from in vivo micro-CT images, directly correlating these images with the severity of lung fibrosis in mice. Fibrosis severity was graded by the Ashcroft scale: none (0), mild (1-3), moderate (4-5), and severe (≥6). The overall accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 scores of the lung fibrosis severity-stratified 3-fold cross validation on 225 micro-CT images for the proposed AI model were 92.9%, 90.9%, 91.6%, and 91.0%, respectively. The overall area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) was 0.990 [95% confidence interval (CI): 0.977, 1.000], with AUROC values of 1.000 for none (100 images, 95% CI: 0.997, 1.000), 0.969 for mild (43 images, 95% CI: 0.918, 1.000), 0.992 for moderate (36 images, 95% CI: 0.962, 1.000), and 0.992 for severe (46 images, 95% CI: 0.967, 1.000). Preliminary results indicate that AI-assisted, in vivo micro-CT-based semiquantitative measurements of murine are feasible and likely accurate. This novel method holds promise as a tool to improve the reproducibility of experimental studies in animal models of IPF.<b>NEW & NOTEWORTHY</b> To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first attempt to establish a direct link between radiological images and the severity of experimental lung fibrosis using artificial intelligence (AI). The proposed method, which accurately quantifies the degree of lung fibrosis in longitudinal observations of experimental animals, has the potential to serve as a new tool to improve the reproducibility of experimental studies in animals with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF)."
"Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic autoimmune inflammatory disease that affects approximately 0.5% to 1% of the population in the United States and Northern Europe. Interstitial lung disease (ILD) is the most common and severe pulmonary manifestation of RA, collectively referred to as RA-associated ILD (RA-ILD). RA-ILD contributes significantly to morbidity and mortality and often presents with a variable clinical course. Although corticosteroids and disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) remain the cornerstone of RA management, their role in RA-ILD is less clearly defined. In contrast, antifibrotic therapies such as pirfenidone and nintedanib, initially developed for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, are now being explored for their potential in treating fibrosing variants of RA-ILD. Despite increasing clinical use, no systematic review has comprehensively compared the safety and efficacy of antifibrotic versus anti-inflammatory therapies in chronic RA-ILD. This study aims to compare the impact of antifibrotic and anti-inflammatory therapies on lung function, radiologic progression, clinical outcomes, and safety in patients with chronic RA-ILD. This study will follow PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines and is registered with PROSPERO (CRD42024583847). A comprehensive search of PubMed, Embase, and the Cochrane Library will be conducted for studies published between January 1991 and August 2024. Eligible studies will include adult patients (aged ≥18 years) with a diagnosis of RA and confirmed ILD based on radiological or histopathological findings who have been treated with either antifibrotic or anti-inflammatory therapies. The PECOS (Population, Exposure, Comparator, Outcome, Study Design) framework will be used to define inclusion criteria. The primary outcomes assessed in this review will include the following pulmonary function parameters: forced vital capacity, forced expiratory volume in 1 second, and diffusing capacity of the lungs for carbon monoxide. Anti-inflammatory therapies will be stratified into corticosteroids, conventional synthetic DMARDs, and biologic DMARDs to account for heterogeneity. The Cochrane Risk of Bias 2 (RoB 2) and Risk of Bias in Non-randomized Studies - of Interventions (ROBINS-I) tools will be used for quality assessment, and GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation) methodology will be used to evaluate the certainty of evidence. The literature search and screening commenced in August 2024, and data extraction is underway. The final results are expected by December 2025. This systematic review and meta-analysis will provide a comprehensive comparison of antifibrotic and anti-inflammatory therapies in the treatment of chronic RA-ILD. The findings will help inform clinical decision-making, support evidence-based treatment selection, and identify gaps in current research. By addressing both efficacy and safety, this review aims to guide future studies and improve patient outcomes for this complex and debilitating condition.

"This study aims to explore the pharmacodynamic material basis of Jinbei Oral Liquid(JBOL) against idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis(IPF) based on serum pharmacochemistry and network pharmacology. The ultra-high performance liquid chromatography-quadrupole time-of-flight tandem mass spectrometry(UHPLC-Q-TOF-MS/MS) technology was employed to analyze and identify the components absorbed into rat blood after oral administration of JBOL. Combined with network pharmacology, the study explored the pharmacodynamic material basis and potential mechanism of JBOL against IPF through protein-protein interaction(PPI) network construction, &quot;component-target-pathway&quot; analysis, Gene Ontology(GO) functional enrichment, and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes(KEGG) pathway enrichment analysis. First, a total of 114 compounds were rapidly identified in JBOL extract according to the exact relative molecular mass, fragment ions, and other information of the compounds with the use of reference substances and a self-built compound database. Second, on this basis, 70 prototype components in blood were recognized by comparing blank serum with drug-containing serum samples, including 28 flavonoids, 25 organic acids, 4 saponins, 4 alkaloids, and 9 others. Finally, using these components absorbed into blood as candidates, the study obtained 212 potential targets of JBOL against IPF. The anti-IPF mechanism might involve the action of active ingredients such as glycyrrhetinic acid, cryptotanshinone, salvianolic acid B, and forsythoside A on core targets like AKT1, TNF, and ALB and thereby the regulation of multiple signaling pathways including PI3K/AKT, HIF-1, and TNF. In conclusion, JBOL exerts the anti-IPF effect through multiple components, targets, and pathways. The results would provide a reference for further study on pharmacodynamic material basis and pharmacological mechanism of JBOL."
"The global incidence and prevalence of interstitial lung disease (ILD) are difficult to determine due to the rarity of the condition, inconsistent case ascertainment and reporting methods, and differences in risk factors, burden of exposures, and access to health-care systems across geographical areas. With these caveats, several studies have reported an increased incidence and prevalence of ILD over time. Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis is the most common and extensively studied ILD, whereas connective tissue disease-associated ILD and hypersensitivity pneumonitis display the most geographical variability. Except for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, connective tissue disease-associated ILD, hypersensitivity pneumonitis, and sarcoidosis, few data are available for other ILDs. Access to health care remains uneven particularly in low-income and middle-income countries, leading to major health disparities. Socioeconomic inequalities also affect morbidity and mortality within and across countries. We performed a non-systematic review of the most recent literature on the epidemiology and burden of ILD, and highlighted areas where substantial gaps in knowledge remain and further studies are needed. The introduction of new tools, including nationwide health-care databases and monitoring of air pollution exposure, is opening new avenues for ILD epidemiology research; however, we are only at the beginning of understanding how the interaction between genetic and environmental factors contributes to the rising burden of these deadly diseases."
"Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) is crucial for the diagnosis of interstitial lung disease (ILD). Although BAL lymphocytosis is found in patients with connective tissue disease (CTD)-related ILD, the effects of CTD-associated features on BAL lymphocytosis have not been elucidated. To identify CTD-associated features that affect BAL lymphocyte fraction in patients with idiopathic interstitial pneumonia (IIP). This post hoc analysis of a prospective, multicentre cohort study was conducted between 2015 and 2020. Overall, 222 patients newly diagnosed with IIP were consecutively enrolled, and 74 autoimmune features were comprehensively analysed during IIP diagnosis. The median age was 71 years, and the median observation period was 36 months. The clinical characteristics related to a significant increase in BAL lymphocyte fraction were consolidation opacity on high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT), morphologic domain of interstitial pneumonia with autoimmune features (IPAF), serum CXCL10 concentration, and acute/subacute onset (all p < 0.05). In contrast, presence of joint lesion/mucocutaneous lesion/dry symptoms, autoantibodies, or other CTD-like features on HRCT and surgical lung biopsy did not affect the BAL lymphocyte fraction (all p ≥ 0.05). Furthermore, a high BAL lymphocyte fraction (≥ 8.5%) was related to a low proportion of progressive pulmonary fibrosis (p < 0.001) and favourable survival (log-rank, p = 0.020) in patients with non-idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). IPAF morphologic domain especially with consolidation opacity on HRCT and high CXCL10 concentration, but not CTD-like symptoms, autoantibodies, or CTD-like features on lung biopsy, were related to a high BAL lymphocyte fraction with favourable survival in patients with non-IPF."
"Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a common mesenchymal lung disease. Inhibiting of the PIM-1 protein has been identified as a promising therapeutic strategy for IPF. Previous studies have shown that paeonol has certain activity against IPF. To identify more potent compound, a total of 41 novel paeonol-based derivatives were designed, synthesized, and their activity was evaluated by inducing fibrotic phenotypes in NIH-3T3 cells in vitro. Among them, compound B6 demonstrated potent activity (inhibitory rates = 91.2 ± 1.7 %) with low toxicity (viability rate = 99.7 ± 0.42 %). CETSA analysis revealed that it could bind to PIM-1. Further studies indicated that it effectively regulated the production of IPF markers, including collagen I and α-SMA. In bleomycin (BLM)-induced IPF mice model, it also significantly inhibited the phosphorylation of p65 in lung tissues and influenced the production of SASP factors, including IL-6, IL-1β, and IL-10. These results suggest that compound B6 may serve as a promising lead compound for alleviating the clinical symptoms of IPF."
"Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a serious chronic lung disease characterized by progressive dyspnea and deterioration of lung function. According to existing observations, platelet activation and fibroblast-myofibroblast differentiation plays an important role in the development of IPF. This study aimed to investigate the role of podoplanin (PDPN) in this differentiation process during IPF progression. Specifically, the article explores PDPN expression in human IPF and bleomycin (BLM)-induced pulmonary fibrosis in mice, along with the effects and mechanisms of the PDPN monoclonal antibody SZ168 on pulmonary fibrosis both in vitro and in vivo. Data analysis of human IPF datasets to identify PDPN as a differentially expressed gene. Following this, in vivo and in vitro experiments were conducted to investigate the role and underlying mechanisms of PDPN in the progression of IPF. Additionally, we measured PDPN levels in the serum of IPF patients to validate its differential expression. Our findings show that PDPN is highly expressed in IPF patients. Additionally, PDPN expression is elevated in TGF-β1-induced fibroblasts and in the lungs of bleomycin-induced mouse models. We particularly found that PDPN was expressed in WI-38 human pulmonary fibroblasts. Knockdown of PDPN in fibroblasts suppresses TGF-β-induced differentiation into myofibroblasts. Furthermore, the PDPN monoclonal antibody SZ168 inhibits platelet-induced fibroblast differentiation. Mechanistic analysis reveals that PDPN promotes bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis via the activation of the RhoA/ROCK signaling pathway. PDPN is significantly upregulated in the pathogenesis of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), and closely associated with the differentiation of fibroblasts into myofibroblasts. The monoclonal antibody SZ168 effectively inhibits platelet activation, thereby inhibiting the differentiation of fibroblasts induced by PDPN and mitigating the progression of pulmonary fibrosis."
"Here, we present a combination of cell and gene therapy that harnesses the regenerative properties of GDF11 in age-related pulmonary fibrosis. Our genome-edited SafeCell-GDF11 mouse embryonic stem cell line provides controlled proliferation and efficient derivation to lung progenitors while inducibly expressing GDF11. When these cells were transplanted into bleomycin-injured aged mice, they acted as a source of reparative cells, restoring the damaged alveolar epithelium. Furthermore, the transplanted cells acted as an ""in situ factory,"" enabling the production of GDF11 in response to the inducer drug. This approach attenuated age-associated senescence and led to the successful resolution of fibrosis. Our study presents a GDF11-expressing cell-based strategy that demonstrates the feasibility of promoting alveolar regeneration in a mouse model of age-related pulmonary fibrosis. Additionally, this approach offers a versatile tool that can be expanded to incorporate other regenerative and anti-aging factors. This helps overcome limitations such as high production costs and a short half-life of therapeutic factors. One of the strengths of our system is its ability to allow precise regulation of factor expression when needed to address specific aging phenotypes."
"The architecture of the mammalian lung is both intricate and distinct. The respiratory system consists of a complex network of semirigid airway tubes, stretching from the trachea to the alveoli, highly vascularized sacs responsible for gas exchange. This system demands precise regulation. The mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) functions as a receptor and regulatory hub for various cellular processes, including metabolism, proliferation, and autophagy, and plays a pivotal role in lung development and regeneration, continuing to influence cellular processes into early childhood. Over the past decade, studies have identified abnormally elevated mTOR activity in adult lung diseases such as acute lung injury and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, leading to the approval of mTOR inhibitors for clinical use. However, during fetal lung development and the postnatal period, mTOR often exhibits a dual role. Its dynamic expression requires careful adaptation to temporal and spatial variations. The safety and efficacy of mTOR inhibitors during these developmental windows remain uncertain, as the role of mTOR becomes increasingly complex in response to the dramatic changes in lung tissue. This review aims to analyze the regulatory mechanisms and functional roles of the mTOR pathway throughout various stages of lung development and adult pulmonary diseases, highlighting the need for caution in using mTOR inhibitors during critical developmental phases. Careful evaluation is essential when considering pharmaceutical interventions for abnormal lung development and pediatric pulmonary disorders."
"Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a fatal interstitial lung disease characterized by progressive fibrosis of lung parenchyma. The histopathology of IPF exhibits temporal and spatial heterogeneity, including immature fibroblastic foci (FF) and densely collagenized fibrosis. FF serve as dynamic niches of profibrotic fibroblasts and play a pivotal role in fibrosis progression and transition into dense fibrosis (DF). Here, we integrated single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) with spatial transcriptomics to elucidate cellular heterogeneity and the novel cell type involved not only in FF formation but also in DF development. We identified a novel myofibroblast population, <i>WNT5A</i>+ <i>CTHRC1</i>+ myofibroblasts, enriched in both FF and DF regions, underscoring their pivotal role in fibrosis progression. Differential gene expression analysis revealed the activation of p21-activated kinase 2 (PAK2) in these fibrotic areas, including <i>WNT5A</i>+ <i>CTHRC1</i>+ myofibroblasts. PAK inhibition significantly suppressed TGF-β-induced myofibroblast differentiation and collagen production in IPF-derived fibroblasts. Furthermore, in a bleomycin-induced lung fibrosis mouse model, intraperitoneal administration of the PAK inhibitor significantly attenuated fibrotic progression. This study highlights the therapeutic potential of PAK inhibition for IPF, particularly targeting pathogenic fibroblasts within both FF and DF regions. By leveraging spatial transcriptomics and scRNA-seq, we provide a comprehensive molecular and cellular atlas of FF and DF in IPF lung tissue, offering new insights into fibrosis progression and therapeutic intervention."
"Extracellular Vesicles (EVs), released by all cell types and detectable in biological samples, carry a variety of biological molecules. These molecules mediate communication and signaling with both local and distant cells, potentially playing a role in the pathogenesis of diseases, including Interstitial Lung Diseases and, more specifically, Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis. To better understand the role of EVs in IPF, a systematic search was performed in PubMed, Scopus, and Ovid databases. These searches were conducted from January 1<sup>st</sup>, 2019, the period during which the MISEV 2018 guidelines were published, to August 31<sup>st</sup>, 2024. The SANRA scale was used for quality assessment. A total of 691 papers were screened, and 16, in the end, were definitively enrolled for our evaluation. The studies were reviewed in the following steps: 1) the nomenclature used to define EVs; 2) conformity with the MISEV 2018 guidelines; 3) the biological samples used to isolate EVs; 4) the main conclusion of each manuscript. There was significant heterogeneity among the publications in all the aforementioned steps, such as the type and source of EVs and the analysis of EVs content, primarily a wide array of different miRNAs in the various publications. Despite these differences, the emerging role of EVs and their potential usefulness both in therapies and clinical practice is of growing interest."
"Previous studies have suggested a potential correlation between obesity and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). This study aimed to elucidate pathogenic pathways connecting obesity and IPF and identify diagnostic biomarkers for obesity-related pulmonary fibrosis. Obesity and IPF datasets were obtained through the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database. Differential expression analysis and weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) were used to identify shared genes for obesity and IPF. Functional enrichment (GO/KEGG), protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks, and machine learning algorithms were applied to screen hub genes, validated by ROC curves. High-fat diet (HFD)-induced obese mice with bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis underwent histological assessment and qRT-PCR validation. Molecular docking evaluated flavonoid binding to hub genes. We identified 128 shared genes between obesity and IPF, predominantly enriched in immune and inflammatory pathways. Machine learning prioritized three hub genes (NLRC4, SPI1, and NCF2), validated by ROC analysis (AUC > 0.7). In animal model, these genes exhibited significant upregulation, correlating with exacerbated fibrosis. Molecular docking highlighted strong binding affinities (-6.3 to -9.6 kcal/mol) between dietary flavonoids and hub targets. Immune-inflammatory dysregulation links obesity and IPF via NLRC4, SPI1, and NCF2. These genes serve as diagnostic biomarkers and therapeutic targets, with flavonoids showing intervention potential. Our findings advance mechanistic insights into obesity-related pulmonary fibrosis."
"Interstitial lung diseases are a heterogeneous group of disorders characterized by inflammation and/or fibrosis of the lung parenchyma, leading to a progressive loss of lung function. Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a representative model with a pathophysiology common to other types of pulmonary fibrosis. This review presents the pathophysiological mechanisms and existing and developing antifibrotic therapies of IPF. Qualitative study through a narrative review of the pathophysiological phenomena of IPF and advances in antifibrotic therapy. The role of the alveolar epithelium, fibroblast/myofibroblast activity, cellular senescence and aging, immune system activity, oxidation-reduction mechanisms and genetic characteristics have been identified, which reveal the complex pathophysiology of this disease. Currently, there are only two therapies available to mitigate the effects of pulmonary fibrosis, Pirfenidone and Nintedanib, and the development and research of other antifibrotic drugs is still pending. There are multiple pathophysiological phenomena in IPF. Understanding them is the basis for the development and evolution of antifibrotic therapies."
"Acute and repetitive lung epithelial injury can lead to irreversible and even progressive pulmonary fibrosis; Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a fatal disease and quintessential example of this phenomenon. The composition of epithelial cells in human pulmonary fibrosis - irrespective of disease etiology - is marked by the presence of Aberrant Basaloid cells: an abnormal cell phenotype with pro-fibrotic and senescent features, localized to the surface of fibrotic lesions. Despite their relevance to human pulmonary fibrosis, the exotic molecular profile of Aberrant Basaloid cells has obscured their etiology, preventing insights into how or why these cells emerge with fibrosis. Here we identify cellular intermediaries between Aberrant Basaloid and normal alveolar epithelial cells in human IPF tissue. We track the emergence of Aberrant Basaloid cells from alveolar epithelial cells <i>ex vivo</i> and uncover a role for similar cells in epithelial regeneration under normal conditions. Lastly, we characterize the epigenetic changes that distinguish Aberrant Basaloid cells from their progenitors and identify hallmarks of AP-1 injury memory retention. This study elucidates the phenomenon of maladaptive epithelial plasticity and regeneration in pulmonary fibrosis and re-contextualizes therapeutic strategies for epithelial dysfunction."
"Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a progressive fibrotic pulmonary disease with unknown etiology. Since approved idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) drugs only slow disease progression, novel therapeutics are required that improve clinical outcomes. Here, we report a single cell RNA-Seq and regulatory network analysis of the largest IPF cohort assembled to date. Segregating this cohort based on status of treatment with approved antifibrotics (untreated, nintedanib- and pirfenidone-treated), we describe for the first time the transcriptional landscape of untreated IPF across 40 lung cell types, and the elements of this program that are impacted by approved antifibrotics. On average, 60% of the untreated IPF-dysregulated transcriptome is refractory to treatment with these drugs, a transcriptional deficit we refer to as the IPF therapeutic gap. Regulatory network analysis indicated a dominant functional footprint for the transcription factor STAT3 in both untreated IPF and in the IPF therapeutic gap. Validating our analysis in a translational precision cut lung slice platform that recapitulates IPF explants, treatment with a STAT3 inhibitor reduced the IPF therapeutic gap in numerous lung cell types. Finally, we implicated STAT3 as a master transcription factor that regulates a network comprising numerous profibrotic transcription factors in IPF alveolar fibroblasts, a critical fibrotic cell lineage. Our study represents a comprehensive resource for translational lung fibrosis research and establishes a novel strategy for drug discovery in human disease more broadly."
"Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a chronic progressive pulmonary disease characterized by alveolar structural destruction and fibrosis. In recent years, efferocytosis has been recognized as playing a crucial role in the occurrence and progression of IPF. This study aimed to identify and regulate key efferocytosis-related genes to elucidate their potential roles and clinical significance in IPF. IPF-related datasets (GSE32537) were obtained from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database. Differential gene expression analysis and weighted gene coexpression network analysis (WGCNA) were applied to identify key genes associated with IPF, intersecting them with efferocytosis-related genes (ERGs) to obtain IPF-ERGs. Protein‒protein interaction (PPI) network construction and enrichment analysis were performed to elucidate the potential functions of these genes in IPF. Seven machine learning algorithms were employed to screen for hub genes with high diagnostic value. The GSE70866 dataset was used for validation, and a nomogram was constructed. Additionally, the CIBERSORT algorithm was used to analyze immune infiltration levels, and transcriptomic validation of the hub genes was conducted in animal experiments. A total of 21 IPF-ERGs were identified, and machine learning further identified TLR2, ATG7, SPHK1, and ICAM1 as hub genes, which were significantly upregulated in the IPF group. Immune infiltration analysis revealed a significant increase in the infiltration levels of immune cell subsets, including memory B cells, CD8 + T cells, and resting dendritic cells, in the IPF group. Further clinical correlation analysis revealed a strong association between the expression levels of the hub genes and pulmonary function. A nomogram was constructed on the basis of the hub genes and validated for its potential clinical application. Consensus clustering classified IPF patients into two subtypes: C1, which was primarily by metabolic pathway activation, and C2, which was enriched in inflammatory and immune pathways. Transcriptomic analysis of animal experiments also confirmed the upregulation of hub gene expression in IPF. This study identified TLR2, ATG7, SPHK1, and ICAM1 as four key hub genes, revealing their potential diagnostic value and biological functions in IPF. These genes may serve as potential diagnostic biomarkers and therapeutic targets, providing new insights for precision treatment. Not applicable."
"Lung diseases such as idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) are associated with significant morbidity and mortality, with limited treatment options. Platelet-derived growth factor receptor beta (PDGFRβ) signaling pathway is a key driver of fibrogenesis in different organs. In the lungs, pericytes have a high PDGFRβ expression, and their role as immune regulators and progenitors of myofibroblasts is increasingly recognized. Non-invasive techniques to assess active lung tissue remodeling are needed to improve disease monitoring and treatment evaluation. This study aimed to evaluate [<sup>18</sup>F]TZ-Z09591, targeting PDGFRβ, for imaging pulmonary injuries in human biopsies, and in vivo in animal models of lung injury. [<sup>18</sup>F]TZ-Z09591 demonstrated high and specific binding to PDGFRβ-expressing cells. Autoradiography confirmed tracer uptake in lung injuries, including fibrotic foci, from human, rat, and pig lung tissues. In vivo positron emission tomography (PET) imaging of bleomycin-induced lung fibrosis in rats and an ARDS pig model showed significantly increased uptake in diseased lung segments compared to controls, especially in pulmonary injuries with collagen deposition, despite moderate background uptake. This study demonstrated that [<sup>18</sup>F]TZ-Z09591 can assess PDGFRβ expression in pulmonary injuries, supporting its potential for non-invasive assessment of lung tissue remodeling. PET imaging targeting PDGFRβ could improve disease monitoring, and provide new insights into pulmonary fibrosis progression."
"Recent studies have suggested an increased incidence of various lung diseases following COVID-19 vaccination. However, causal relationships have not been definitively established. We conducted a two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) study using publicly available genome-wide association study data to investigate potential causal relationships between COVID-19 vaccination status as the exposure and 14 different lung diseases as outcomes. The analytical methods included random-effects inverse-variance weighting, MR Egger, and weighted median, with additional heterogeneity and sensitivity analyses. Seven instrumental variables for exposure were selected (P < 5 × 10-8). MR analyses revealed that COVID-19 vaccination status was not associated with an increased risk of developing overall lung cancer (P = .78), lung adenocarcinoma (P = .557), squamous cell lung cancer (P = .557), non-small cell lung cancer (P = .173), asthma (P = .905), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, bronchiectasis (P = .669), forced vital capacity (FVC), forced expiratory volume in 1 second/FVC (P = .794), pneumonia (P = .282), idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (P = .486), pulmonary embolism (P = .267), pneumothorax (P = .73), or sarcoidosis (P = .732). Evidence of heterogeneity was observed in the inverse-variance weighting model for overall lung cancer, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and FVC, whereas no indications of horizontal pleiotropy or significant heterogeneity were noted for other lung diseases. COVID-19 vaccination does not appear to increase the risk of developing various lung diseases. These findings support the safety of COVID-19 vaccines in terms of respiratory health, reinforcing their role in public health interventions and vaccination policies."
"Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a life-threatening interstitial lung disease and is one of the complications observed in individuals following COVID-19 infection. Although inhalable nanomedicines hold promise, nebulization-induced shear stress, dense airway mucus barrier, and inefficient <i>in vivo</i> clearance substantially compromise nanomedicine delivery efficiency and biosafety, thereby limiting their therapeutic efficacies. Herein, an inhalable microenvironment-responsive hybrid nanomedicine (PFD@FPNs-CAT) encapsulated with pirfenidone (PFD) and modified with catalase (CAT) is developed, which is able to overcome the supramolecular interactions owing to the small particle size, electronegativity, and PEGylated surface, thus enhancing the accumulation of PFD@FPNs-CAT in the lesions. Moreover, the surface-anchored CAT is demonstrated to relieve hypoxia, thus reversing the immunosuppressive microenvironment and further enhancing the therapeutic efficacy against IPF. Notably, due to the relatively low quantity of silica doping, PFD@FPNs-CAT demonstrates high stability and excellent biocompatibility. This inhalable mucus-penetrating nanomedicine remarkably inhibits the progression of IPF, illuminating the bright prospects for IPF therapy."
"Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), a chronic progressive fibrosing interstitial lung disease with an unclear etiology, is characterized by progressive respiratory impairment and a median survival of 3-5 years. The pathophysiology associated with genetic factors in IPF remains largely unknown, despite the fact that both familial and sporadic IPF exhibit genetic susceptibility. In this review, we comprehensively examine genetic variations associated with the functional roles of mucin 5B (MUC5B), telomerase complex, surfactant proteins, cytokines, signaling pathways, and epigenetic mechanisms. A multifaceted perspective derived from genetic, epidemiological, and clinical studies demonstrates that genetic variations exert differential impacts on the development, progression, and prognosis of IPF. We advocate for the application of genetic knowledge to facilitate the refinement of diagnostic approaches, enhance the assessment of therapeutic strategies and prognostic outcomes, and underscore the significance of personalized therapy for IPF."
"Neurological symptoms are commonly observed in patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). However, the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Although exercise has been shown to improve pulmonary fibrosis and quality of life in IPF patients, its effects on neurological symptoms in this population are not well understood. Furthermore, a robust animal model linking IPF with comorbid neurological symptoms has not yet been fully developed. Twenty-eight male C57BL/6J mice were divided into four groups: control, bleomycin (BLM), control + exercise, and BLM + exercise. Mice were administered BLM or saline (7.5 mg/kg), and the exercise groups underwent 45 min of treadmill training per day for 28 days. Behavioral tests (open-field test, sucrose preference test, tail suspension test, and forced swimming test) were performed on days 29-33. Histological analysis assessed pulmonary fibrosis, and biomarkers brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and c-Fos were detected. Bioinformatics identified genes altered in IPF, exercise, and depression, validated by Western blotting. BLM induced pulmonary fibrosis and aggravated neurological symptoms. Exercise significantly alleviated these symptoms and reversed the expression of BDNF and c-Fos. Bioinformatics analysis identified 28 genes upregulated in IPF and depression and downregulated by exercise. The S100A12 gene showed reduced expression in both lung and brain tissues in the BLM group and increased expression after exercise. Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes analysis revealed enrichment in the Interleukin 17 (IL-17) and Nucleotide-binding Oligomerization Domain (NOD)-like receptor signaling pathways. This study developed a mouse model and suggests that exercise may offer therapeutic benefits for both pulmonary and neurological symptoms in IPF. Shared molecular pathways may guide future therapies targeting both aspects."
"Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), a chronic interstitial lung disease, is characterized by aberrant wound healing, excessive scarring and the formation of myofibroblastic foci. Although the role of alternative splicing (AS) in the pathogenesis of organ fibrosis has garnered increasing attention, its specific contribution to pulmonary fibrosis remains incompletely understood. In this study, we identified an up-regulation of serine/arginine-rich splicing factor 7 (SRSF7) in lung fibroblasts derived from IPF patients and a bleomycin (BLM)-induced mouse model, and further characterized its functional role in both human fetal lung fibroblasts and mice. We demonstrated that enhanced expression of Srsf7 in mice spontaneously induced alveolar collagen accumulation. Mechanistically, we investigated alternative splicing events and revealed that SRSF7 modulates the alternative splicing of pyruvate kinase (PKM), leading to metabolic dysregulation and fibroblast activation. <i>In vivo</i> studies showed that fibroblast-specific knockout of <i>Srsf7</i> in conditional knockout mice conferred resistance to bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis. Importantly, through drug screening, we identified lomitapide as a novel modulator of SRSF7, which effectively mitigated experimental pulmonary fibrosis. Collectively, our findings elucidate a molecular pathway by which SRSF7 drives fibroblast metabolic dysregulation and propose a potential therapeutic strategy for pulmonary fibrosis."
"Emerging evidence suggests a significant association between monocytes and the pathophysiology and prognosis of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). This review aims to systematically evaluate current knowledge regarding blood monocyte counts and their relationship with the etiology, progression, and prognosis of IPF. We conducted a systematic search in the PubMed database for articles published through 17 February 2025, using the MeSH terms ""lung diseases, interstitial"" and ""monocytes,"" which yielded 314 results. After filtering for full-text articles in English (n = 242), we included only studies focusing on blood monocyte counts with clinical implications in IPF. Articles relating to other cell types or non-IPF lung diseases were excluded. Our systematic search identified 12 relevant articles. Monocytes play an essential role in regulating inflammatory responses and resolution across multiple diseases, with established but incompletely understood contributions to lung fibrosis development in IPF. Correlations have been demonstrated between elevated blood monocyte counts and the following: (1) the presence and progression of interstitial lung abnormalities, (2) the progression from an indeterminate usual interstitial pneumonia (UIP) pattern on CT scans to definitive IPF, and (3) worse lung function parameters, an increased risk of acute exacerbations, and reduced overall survival in IPF patients. Monocytes serve as critical orchestrators throughout IPF's natural history-from early interstitial changes to disease progression and acute exacerbations. Targeting monocyte recruitment pathways and reprogramming their differentiation represents a promising therapeutic approach, while circulating monocyte counts offer potential as accessible biomarkers for disease progression and treatment response. Future research should characterize stage-specific monocyte phenotypes to enable precision-targeted interventions."
"The uncontrolled fibrosis of lung tissue can lead to premature death in patients suffering from idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), and it complicates the course of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and emphysema. It is also a risk factor for developing lung cancer. Antifibrotic drugs, such as nantedanib and pirfenidone, are able to slow down the progression of pulmonary fibrosis, but more effective treatment is still needed to reverse it. Studies on the pathogenesis of tissue fibrosis have demonstrated that integrins play a crucial role affecting the development of pulmonary fibrosis, for example, by activating transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β). Taking the above into consideration, targeting specific integrins could offer promising opportunities for managing fibroplastic changes in lung tissue. Integrins are a type of transmembrane molecule that mediate interactions between cells and extracellular matrix (ECM) molecules. This review discusses the role of integrins in the pathogeneses of respiratory diseases and carcinogenesis, as well as presents promising approaches to the drug therapy of pulmonary fibrosis of various etiologies based on integrin inhibition."
"Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a progressive and fatal lung disease characterized by excessive extracellular matrix (ECM) accumulation, fibroblast activation, and chronic inflammation. This study examined the antifibrotic effects of naltrexone (NTX), an opioid receptor antagonist, in a bleomycin (BLM)-induced pulmonary fibrosis model in Wistar rats. Daily administration of NTX significantly reduced alveolar wall thickening, collagen deposition, and histopathological injury scores. At higher doses, NTX markedly decreased levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-α, IL-6, TGF-β), oxidative stress markers (MPO, NO), and key fibrotic markers including α-SMA and delta opioid receptor (DOR). Additionally, NTX restored antioxidant defenses (GSH, TAC) and enhanced GSK-3β phosphorylation, thereby modulating the Wnt/β-catenin and NF-κB signaling pathways. To further investigate the cellular mechanisms underlying NTX's antifibrotic activity, in vitro experiments were conducted using BLM-stimulated NIH-3 T3 fibroblasts. NTX inhibited the production of collagen type I and III, tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases (TIMP-1 and TIMP-2), and matrix metalloproteinases (MMP-2 and MMP-9) in a dose- and time-dependent manner. This dual regulation of ECM synthesis and degradation suggests a more balanced therapeutic strategy compared to merely inhibiting collagen accumulation. Molecular docking analyses revealed strong interactions between NTX and key proteins involved in inflammatory and fibrotic signaling cascades. Notably, NTX at a dose of 20 mg/kg demonstrated antifibrotic efficacy comparable to that of pirfenidone. Collectively, these findings suggest that NTX exerts protective effects in pulmonary fibrosis by simultaneously targeting inflammation, oxidative stress, and ECM remodeling. Given its favorable tolerability and potential cost-effectiveness, NTX emerges as a promising candidate for IPF therapy. Further clinical investigations are warranted to evaluate its translational potential."
"This review describes similarities between the biological actions of cell adhesion molecule antagonists and pan-growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase (GF-RTK) antagonists. In particular, the biological consequences of the interaction between the cell adhesion molecule, neural (N)-cadherin (CDH2) and the fibroblast GF-RTK (FGF-RTK) are discussed. Intercellular adhesion mediated by N-cadherin stimulates FGF-RTK activity triggering intracellular signaling pathways (<i>e.g</i>. PI3/Akt/mTOR pathway) that regulate various morphogenetic processes (<i>e.g</i>. apoptosis). Antagonists of either N-cadherin or GF-RTKs modulate these processes. N-cadherin antagonists can be regarded as a previously unappreciated class of FGF-RTK inhibitors. These antagonists, similar to GF-RTK antagonists should be capable of serving as therapeutics for treating a variety of fibrotic diseases and cancers."
"Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a chronic and progressive lung disease that worsens over time, culminating in respiratory failure. Emerging evidence implicates dysregulated energy metabolism in driving fibroblast activation and extracellular matrix remodeling during IPF pathogenesis. To systematically investigate metabolic reprogramming mechanisms, we performed integrated bioinformatics analyses focusing on energy metabolism-related differentially expressed genes (EMRDEGs) and their regulatory networks in fibrotic remodeling. Differentially Expressed Genes (DEGs) were identified by accessing datasets GSE242063 and GSE110147 from the GEO database. Energy metabolism-related genes (EMRGs) were extracted from GeneCards, followed by Venn diagram analysis to obtain EMRDEGs. Subsequent analyses included functional enrichment (GO/KEGG), protein-protein interaction network, and mRNA-miRNA, mRNA-transcription factor interaction networks. Immune infiltration analyses, including the CIBERSORT algorithm, and single-sample gene set enrichment analysis (ssGSEA), were subsequently conducted. We identified 12 EMRDEGs and eight hub genes (<i>ACSL1</i>, <i>CEBPD</i>, <i>CFH</i>, <i>HMGCS1</i>, <i>IL6</i>, <i>SOCS3</i>, <i>TLR2</i>, and <i>UCP2</i>). Regulatory network analysis revealed <i>HMGCS1</i> as a novel IPF-associated gene interacting with PPARα signaling, while <i>SOCS3</i> coordinated multiple hub genes (<i>IL6</i>, <i>CEBPD</i>, <i>UCP2</i>, and <i>CFH</i>) through FOXA1/2-mediated transcriptional regulation alongside JAK/STAT3 pathway suppression. Immune profiling demonstrated significant hub gene-immune cell correlations, particularly neutrophil-mediated differential gene expression and microenvironment remodeling. The core EMRDEGs (<i>HMGCS1</i> and <i>SOCS3</i>) and prioritized pathways (PPARα signaling, FOXA networks, JAK/STAT3 suppression) elucidate metabolic reprogramming mechanisms in fibrotic progression. These molecular signatures provide novel clinical biomarkers for IPF diagnosis."
"Hypereosinophilic Syndrome (HES) represents a heterogeneous and complex group of disorders characterised by persistent blood and tissue eosinophilia, leading to progressive tissue damage and organ dysfunction. This spectrum includes both hematologic variants and non-hematologic forms, either secondary to identifiable causes or idiopathic in nature. In this article, we describe a rare clinical presentation of HES manifesting primarily with pulmonary involvement, diagnosed as Non-Specific Interstitial Pneumonia (NSIP). Remarkably, the interstitial lung disease showed near-complete reversibility following targeted inhibition of the IL-5 pathway with mepolizumab, highlighting the potential role of Th2-driven eosinophilic inflammation in the pathogenesis of certain forms of interstitial lung disease."
"Right ventricular (RV) function is the primary determinant of survival in connective tissue disease-associated pulmonary arterial hypertension (CTD-PAH). A ""double hit"" hypothesis suggests that RV suffers not only from pressure overload common to all PAH but also from direct insults related to the underlying systemic autoimmunity and inflammation. This likely drives distinct maladaptive remodeling (fibrosis, inflammation) and contributes to the poorer prognosis observed in CTD-PAH compared to idiopathic PAH (IPAH).Comprehensive, multi-modal RV assessment - integrating clinical evaluation, biomarkers, echocardiography, cardiac MRI, and right heart catheterization - is crucial for prognosis and monitoring therapy. RV size, function, and tissue characteristics are key indicators.Current management involves PAH-targeted therapies to reduce RV afterload, optimal CTD control, and supportive care. However, CTD-PAH often shows attenuated treatment responses and worse outcomes, emphasizing the need for therapies directly addressing RV maladaptation. Future research priorities include understanding specific RV injury mechanisms in CTD, refining assessment tools, and developing novel RV-directed strategies. Optimizing outcomes requires a deep understanding of RV pathobiology within the CTD context and integrated, multidisciplinary care."
"Emerging evidence suggests a potential relationship between lipid metabolism and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). This study aimed to identify lipid-related genes implicated in IPF pathogenesis. Lipid-associated genes were retrieved from the GeneCards database and analyzed using unsupervised consensus clustering to classify IPF samples. Weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) was performed on the identified clusters to determine core modules and hub genes associated with IPF. Machine learning algorithms were applied to these hub genes to construct diagnostic and prognostic models, which were validated across multiple datasets. Single-cell sequencing was used to investigate the distribution of potential pathogenic genes, and their functional roles were further validated through cellular experiments. Two distinct clusters were identified, showing significant differences in lung function parameters and fibrosis-related gene expression. WGCNA revealed that the blue module was strongly associated with IPF and served as the core module. Genes from this module were used to construct diagnostic and prognostic models, which demonstrated strong predictive performance across multiple validation datasets. Single-cell sequencing revealed that KLF4 was highly expressed in lung epithelial cells. Functional assays indicated that knockdown of KLF4 did not affect the proliferation of human alveolar type II epithelial cells but significantly enhanced their migratory capacity, thereby promoting the fibrotic process. This study successfully constructed lipid-related diagnostic and prognostic models for IPF and identified KLF4 as a potential causative gene. These findings provide a foundation for further exploration of lipid metabolism in IPF pathogenesis and potential therapeutic strategies targeting KLF4."
"Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis (IPF) is marked by progressive lung scarring with no existing cure, emphasizing the need for new therapeutic targets. Current evidence suggests that cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) mitigates lung fibroblast proliferation <i>via</i> the PKA pathway, but the impact of Epac1, a cAMP-activated protein, on IPF remains unexplored. To investigate the role of Epac1 in IPF progression. We examined lung samples from IPF patients and controls, and from a bleomycin-induced mouse model of pulmonary fibrosis (PF). Epac1's effects were analysed in knock-out mice and through modulation using viral vectors. The Epac1-specific small compound inhibitor AM-001 was evaluated <i>in vitro</i> using lung fibroblasts from patients with IPF, <i>in vivo</i> in bleomycin mice, and <i>ex vivo</i> in IPF precision cut lung slices. Increased Epac1 expression was observed in lung tissues from IPF patients, fibrotic fibroblasts, and bleomycin-challenged mice. Genetic or pharmacological inhibition of Epac1 with AM-001 decreased proliferation in normal and IPF fibroblasts, and reduced expression of pro-fibrotic markers such as α-SMA, TGF-β/SMAD2/3, and IL-6/STAT3 pathways. Epac1-specific inhibition consistently protected against bleomycin-induced lung injury and fibrosis, suggesting a significant therapeutic potential. Global gene expression profiling indicated reduced pro-fibrotic gene signature and neddylation pathway components in Epac1-deficient fibroblasts and human-derived lung cells. Mechanistically, the protective effects may involve inhibiting the neddylation pathway and preventing NEDD8 activation, which in turn reduces the degradation of FoxO3a by NEDD8. Additionally, these effects may be enhanced while also limiting the proliferation of lung-infiltrating monocytes. Our findings demonstrate that Epac1 regulates fibroblast activity in pulmonary fibrosis, and that targeting Epac1 with the pharmacological specific inhibitor AM-001 offers a promising therapeutic approach for treating IPF disease."
"High-resolution CT and pulmonary function tests remain the standard for diagnosing fibrotic interstitial lung diseases (ILDs) butare limited by radiation exposure, access, and inter-observer variability. Blood-based biomarkers could enable earlier, less invasive diagnosis and monitoring. We therefore evaluated the diagnostic accuracy of biomarkers, specifically Krebs von den Lungen-6 (KL-6), surfactant protein A (SP-A), and surfactant protein D (SP-D), in distinguishing fibrotic ILDs from healthy individuals or non-fibrotic respiratory conditions. A systematic review and bivariate random-effects meta-analysis were conducted, comparing serum or bronchoalveolar lavage fluid levels of KL-6, SP-A, or SP-D against histopathology or high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT). Diagnostic accuracy was assessed using sensitivity, specificity, and heterogeneity (I<sup>2</sup>). Subgroup analyses examined disease subtypes, control groups, and biomarker cutoffs. Nineteen studies involving 3,320 participants were included. KL-6 (16 studies, 3,006 participants) had a pooled sensitivity of 0.74 (95 % CI: 0.67-0.80) and specificity of 0.90 (95 % CI: 0.85-0.93). SP-D (11 studies, 1,167 participants) showed a sensitivity of 0.73 (95 % CI: 0.66-0.79) and specificity of 0.78 (95 % CI: 0.69-0.86). SP-A (five studies, 671 participants) had a sensitivity of 0.71 (95 % CI: 0.51-0.85) and specificity of 0.91 (95 % CI: 0.67-0.98). Subgroup analysis showed significantly reduced diagnostic performance in autoimmune-associated ILDs versus idiopathic interstitial pneumonia (e.g., KL-6 specificity 0.87 vs. 0.98; P = 0.015). KL-6 and SP-A demonstrated high specificity and moderate sensitivity, supporting their use to rule in fibrotic ILDs. Diagnostic accuracy was lower in autoimmune interstitial lung diseases (ILDs), suggesting that tailored thresholds or combined testing may be necessary."
"Senescent alveolar epithelial cells (AEC) play a pivotal role in the progression of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), attracting increasing attention from researchers. Central to the pathogenesis of pulmonary fibrosis (PF) is the excessive deposition of extracellular matrix (ECM). However, there remains a significant gap in understanding how the ECM microenvironment influences senescence in type II alveolar epithelial cells (AEC II). This study investigates the activation of the integrin-β<sub>1</sub>/FAK/YAP signaling pathway and its role in inducing cellular senescence in both in vivo and in vitro models of bleomycin (BLM)-induced PF. We employed decellularized lung scaffolds (DLS) to replicate the natural ECM microenvironment, aiming to elucidate whether the fibrotic ECM promotes AEC II senescence through the integrin-β<sub>1</sub>/FAK/YAP pathway. Notably, our findings indicate that exogenous integrin-β<sub>1</sub> does not induce AEC II senescence. This suggests that the fibrotic ECM microenvironment regulates AEC II senescence via the integrin-β<sub>1</sub>/FAK/YAP pathway independently of exogenous integrin-β<sub>1</sub>. Therefore, targeting alterations in the fibrotic ECM microenvironment may represent a promising therapeutic strategy for IPF by modulating AEC II senescence."
"Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is an irreversible and progressive interstitial lung disease that results from excessive tissue repair. Production of excessive extracellular matrix (ECM) by myofibroblasts has been known as an important pathological feature in IPF. Connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) is a secreted matricellular protein modulating myofibroblast activation and ECM deposition, leading to fibrosis and tissue remodeling. Protocatechuic acid is extensively distributed in many edible nuts, vegetables, and fruits and is readily absorbed by both animals and humans. Numerous biological actions of protocatechuic acid (PCA) have been observed, including antibacterial, antidiabetic, antioxidant, and anti-inflammatory characteristics. The purpose of this study is to investigate the protective effect of PCA on bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis in rats. The pathological changes of the lung and levels of malondialdehyde (MDA) and glutathione (GSH) were measured. Our results revealed that PCA decreased the oxidative production of lipid MDA and increased GSH content. Moreover, PCA suppressed the expression of inflammatory biomarkers transforming growth factor β (TGF-β) and tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α), as well as decreased collagen deposition and ECM markers alpha-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA), matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2), and metallopeptidase inhibitor 1 (TIMP-1). PCA has an anti-fibrotic effect against pulmonary fibrosis by downregulation of the CTGF/NOX4/ET-1 gene expression. Also, PCA treatment ameliorated BLM-induced lung damage by improving alveolar sac structure, reducing inflammatory cell infiltration, and preserving bronchiolar epithelial integrity, suggesting that PCA may serve as a potential treatment option for PF."
"Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a rare but devastating diagnosis for patients with only two approved drug therapies. Extensive preclinical studies have identified and characterized novel pathways driving IPF pathogenesis, and researchers have identified several new promising therapeutic targets to help treat IPF. However, translating these preclinical models into viable treatment modalities has proven challenging. This review will address the evolving nature of IPF research, examine the preclinical studies and their target pathways that have advanced to clinical trials, and address the translational gap that has limited the success of novel therapeutic trials for IPF."
"Telomere shortening, a hallmark of cellular aging, is associated with poor outcomes in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). This study aimed to explore the relationships between telomere length (TL), pulmonary function tests, and telomere-related gene (TRG) mutations in a real-world IPF population. We included IPF patients from two Belgian academic hospitals, collecting demographic and clinical data. TL was measured using Flow-FISH and expressed as a percentile. Short TL was defined as below the 10th percentile (P10), and very short TL as below the 1st percentile (P1). We analysed 143 patients (106 men, 74%), with a median age of 70 years. Thirty patients (21%) met the European Respiratory Society (ERS) criteria for familial pulmonary fibrosis (FPF). Short TL was found in 74 patients (50%), predominantly in men (p < 0.05). Patients with short TL experienced a greater decline in lung function over 24 months compared to those with normal TL (- 4% vs + 3% FVC, p < 0.05; - 7% vs - 3% DLCO, p < 0.05). Patients with very short TL were younger at diagnosis and tended to have a more pronounced FVC decline (- 5% vs - 1%, p = 0.06). TRG variants were identified in 16 individuals, occurring more frequently in those with short (14/27, 52%) or very short TL (10/20, 50%). Short TL is common in both sporadic and familial IPF and serves as a predictive biomarker for accelerated lung function decline. Additionally, the presence of short TL is indicative of an underlying TRG mutation."
"Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) frequently coexist, with GERD potentially exacerbating IPF progression through microaspiration and pulmonary inflammation. This systematic review and meta-analysis assessed the impact of anti-reflux therapy, including proton pump inhibitors and H2-receptor antagonists, on mortality outcomes in IPF patients with concurrent GERD. A systematic search identified six eligible studies, including 2874 patients, for quantitative synthesis. Results indicate that anti-reflux therapy may reduce IPF-related mortality, with a pooled relative risk (RR) of 0.79 [95% confidence interval (CI): 0.55-1.33], although this finding was not statistically significant. However, no significant effect was observed on overall mortality (pooled RR: 0.97, 95% CI: 0.74-1.25). Study heterogeneity was moderate (I²=60%), reflecting variability in study designs, populations, and therapeutic regimens. The observational nature of most studies highlights the need for randomized controlled trials to better understand anti-reflux therapy's role in IPF management. While anti-reflux therapy was associated with a potential reduction in IPF-related mortality (RR: 0.79, 95% CI: 0.55-1.33), no significant effect on overall mortality was observed (RR: 0.97, 95% CI: 0.74-1.25). Future research should also evaluate the long-term safety of anti-reflux therapy, given concerns about complications such as infections and renal impairment. This analysis underscores the importance of tailored treatment approaches in IPF patients with GERD to optimize clinical outcomes."
"Alveolar type II (AT2) progenitor cell exhaustion and impaired regenerative capacity are key pathogenic hallmarks in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD <sup>+</sup> ) functions as a central regulator of cellular energy metabolism. We have reported that downregulation of NAD <sup>+</sup> -dependent sirtuin signaling contributes to the impaired progenitor function of IPF AT2s. In this study, we identified that a key NAD <sup>+</sup> biosynthesis enzyme, nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase (NAMPT), is significantly downregulated in IPF AT2s. NAMPT deficiency impairs AT2 renewal and enhances lung fibrosis through downregulation of SIRT7 and SOD2, which results in increased oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, induction of pathological transitional gene expression and impaired regenerative capacity to generate alveolar type I (AT1) cell required for gas exchange. Mice with deletion of Nampt in AT2s showed severely impaired AT2 renewal and increased susceptibility to bleomycin lung injury and spontaneous fibrois. Activation of NAMPT by small molecule activators promoted AT2 renewal, restored homeostasis, and reversed lung fibrosis. NAMPT activation could be a therapeutic strategy for restoring AT2 progenitor function and halting or reversing progressive pulmonary fibrosis."
"Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a progressive, life-threatening lung disease with limited treatment efficacy. <i>Salvia miltiorrhiza</i> (SM), a traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), is widely used in Chinese hospitals due to its antithrombotic, anti-inflammatory, and antioxidant properties. SM has also demonstrated potential as an anti-fibrotic agent. This study aims to investigate the therapeutic effects and mechanisms of SM injection in treating IPF. Active components and targets of SM were acquired from the Traditional Chinese Medicine Systems Pharmacology (TCMSP) database, while IPF-associated genes were obtained from the DisGeNET database. Venn analysis was applied to intersect SM targets with IPF-associated genes, identifying potential therapeutic targets. A protein-protein interaction (PPI) network of these targets was constructed using the STRING database and visualized with Cytoscape software, where the CytoHubba plug-in was utilized to determine core therapeutic targets. Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analyses of the core targets were conducted via R language, and molecular docking was performed to predict the binding affinities of active compounds to the core targets. The core targets were further validated through qRT-PCR, Western blot (WB), and ELISA experiments. 70 potential target genes of SM injection for the treatment of IPF were identified, with MMP9, IL-6, and TNF-<i>α</i> as the core targets. These core targets were linked to pathways involving inflammation, oxidative stress, and extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling. <i>In vitro</i> experiments indicated that SM injection alleviated pulmonary fibrosis by downregulating MMP9, IL-6, and TNF-<i>α</i>. SM injection may effectively reduce pulmonary fibrosis through multi-target mechanisms, providing a new therapeutic strategy for IPF from the perspective of TCM."
"In the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, understanding the influence of pre-existing Interstitial Lung Disease (ILD) on patient outcomes is crucial. This study aimed to compare the impact of COVID-19 on patients with Idiopathic Interstitial Pneumonia (IIP) versus Connective Tissue Disease-related ILD (CTD-ILD) in terms of mortality, length of hospital stay (LOS) and Intensive Care Unit (ICU) admission. The National Inpatient Sample (NIS) database for 2019-2020 identified adult patients hospitalized with COVID-19 and either IP or CTD-ILD. Patient demographics, comorbidities, and outcomes were analyzed. Among 1,010,030 COVID-19 hospitalizations, 11,030 had ILD, with 1,105 associated with CTD. Although both IL and CTD-ILD groups had higher mortality rates than non-ILD patients, there was no significant difference in mortality between CTD-ILD and ILI groups. The odds ratio for mortality was 0.78 (95% CI 0.50-1.2, p = 0.3) for CTD-ILD compared to ILP patients and 1.54 (95% CI 1.03-2.31, p = 0.03) for CTD-ILD compared to non-ILD patients. This study underscores the importance of considering ILD subtypes in predicting COVID-19 outcomes. Despite demographic and comorbidity differences, mortality rates were comparable between CTD-ILD and IIP patients. Further research is needed to explore underlying mechanisms contributing to mortality in different ILD subtypes and the impact of specific rheumatological diseases and treatments on COVID-19 outcomes."
"Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a severe, diffuse, progressive, and fibrosing interstitial disease leading to respiratory failure and death in the absence of organ transplantation. Substantial evidence has confirmed the pivotal role of fibroblasts in the progression of IPF, yet effective therapeutic options are scarce. Single-cell transcriptomics profiling revealed that among the diverse fibroblast subsets, FAP1+ alveolar fibroblasts (AFs) were pivotal for the progression of IPF. On the basis of these findings, we developed FAP1-targeting chimeric antigen receptor cytotoxic effector regulatory T cells (CAR-cTregs), which leveraged the targeted killing advantage of the currently trending CAR-based immunotherapy for tumors and incorporated the immunosuppressive functions of Tregs to mitigate the inflammation caused by both the disease itself and CAR-T cell infusion. Accordingly, CAR-cTregs were constructed to effectively eliminate FAP1+ fibroblasts in vitro. This cytotoxic effect could be abrogated by inhibitors of the granzyme B/perforin pathway. In the bleomycin-induced PF model, CAR-cTregs were found to reverse fibrosis characterized by diminished recruitment of fibrocytes and improved remodeling of epithelial cells. Together, our results demonstrate that CAR-cTregs can serve as a promising therapeutic option for IPF and provide an alternative strategy for treating multiple chronic inflammatory diseases by inducing both cytotoxicity and immunosuppression."
"Pulmonary fibrosis is defined as progressive based on the combination of radiological, clinical, and functional criteria. Nintedanib can reduce the rate of lung function decline, but no data are available on its effectiveness to hamper disease progression evaluated by these criteria. The primary aim of the study was to assess the number of patients with progressive pulmonary fibrosis (PPF) who no longer meet progression criteria after one year of treatment with nintedanib. A retrospective, observational, multicenter study was carried out in Italy. 172 patients (91 (52.9%) males) with PPF were recruited, and 135 (78.5%) completed one year of treatment. After one year, 87 (64.4%) patients no longer met INBUILD progression criteria, while 107 (79.3%) did not meet 2022 ATS/ERS/JRS/ALAT guidelines criteria. Nintedanib hampered progression regardless of inclusion criteria, radiological pattern, and etiological diagnosis. Forced vital capacity (FVC) decline was significantly higher in the 12 months before than in those of treatment (mean, SD): 2512.3 (863.2) ml vs. 2313.6 (821.9) ml; p < 0.0001; 2313.6 (821.9) vs. 2335.7 (865.1); p = 0.82). FVC decline was significantly higher in the year before than in the year of treatment regardless of radiological pattern, etiological subtypes, and respiratory function. Diarrhea (mostly mild) was the most frequent adverse event (51.7%). A permanent discontinuation of the drug was recorded in 15 (9%) patients. Nintedanib is effective and safe in patients with PPF. Besides slowing lung function decline, it hampers progression regardless of etiological diagnosis, radiological pattern, respiratory function, and baseline inclusion criteria."
"Animal models play a crucial role in understanding disease mechanisms and testing potential therapeutic approaches. However, traditional murine models of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) that rely on a single-dose bleomycin injection fail to accurately replicate the complex pathological features observed in IPF patients. This study introduces an improved method using two successive oropharyngeal administrations of bleomycin in mice, which more effectively mimics the progression of IPF. This novel protocol induces key pathological changes, such as the formation of honeycomb-like cysts, fibroblastic foci, and bronchiolization of the alveolar epithelium, closely resembling the histopathology seen in human IPF. By utilizing this model, we are able to capture the progressive fibrotic changes over a longer time frame, which provides more reliable insights into the pathogenesis of IPF. Furthermore, this two-dose approach offers several advantages over conventional single-dose models, including better reproducibility and a more robust representation of the disease's development. This method enhances our ability to study the mechanisms underlying IPF and evaluate potential therapeutic interventions. The proposed protocol offers significant advancement in preclinical research and provides a valuable tool for investigating both the biology of pulmonary fibrosis and the efficacy of novel treatments."
"Codonopsis radix (CR), an herbal medicine, has been officially named and used since Wu Yiluo's ""Bentushu Letter"" in the Qing Dynasty. It has the effect of invigorating the spleen and lung, nourishing blood, and benefiting body fluid. However, there are few reports on the impact of CR on idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). This study evaluated the therapeutic effects of CR on IPF through in vivo and in vitro experiments and explored possible mechanisms. Specifically, we aimed to clarify whether the main pharmacodynamic components in CR exert synergistic regulatory effects and to reveal the underlying synergistic mechanism. The water extract group (CWE), polysaccharide group (CP), and small molecules group (CS) were successfully extracted from CR, the CS components were purified, and the CWE and CP components were preliminarily characterized. Next, based on the activation of lung fibroblasts by transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1), Compusyn software was used to analyze the combination index (CI) of CS and CP. The effects of CR components on fibroblast differentiation, proliferation, apoptosis, and related signaling pathways were studied. Based on the bleomycin (BLM) induced IPF model in rats, the effects of CR on histopathologic manifestations and fibrotic marker expression levels were observed. Histological analysis, immunofluorescence, and Western blot were used to observe changes in CR effective components after intervention. The synergies of CS and CP components in CR and their effects on related signaling pathways were evaluated to identifypotential anti-IPF mechanisms. In vitro experiments confirmed a synergistic effect when the CS to CP ratio was 1:8. The effective components of CR reversed TGF-β1-induced proliferation, migration, and extracellular matrix (ECM) deposition in MRC-5 cells while promoting cell apoptosis. CP and CS components exhibited a synergistic effect. Additionally, results showed that CR effective components inhibited fibroblast differentiation into myofibroblasts. In vivo pharmacodynamic evaluation and mechanism demonstrated that CR effective components improved the severity of BLM-induced IPF in rats, as evidenced by histopathological manifestations and fibrosis marker expression levels. The synergistic anti-IPF mechanism of CS and CP components in CR was linked to interference with the TGF-β1/Smad signaling pathway. This study for the first time revealed that the main anti-IPF pharmacological active components of CR are derived from CS and CP components, with an optimal CS:CP ratio of 1:8. They inhibit fibroblast proliferation by suppressing TGF-β1/Smad-mediated expression of proliferative proteins (PCNA, Survivin) and promote Bcl-2/Bax-regulated fibroblast apoptosis, thereby reducing ECM deposition proteins (FN, α-SMA, Col-I). By inhibiting the transformation of fibroblasts into myofibroblasts, they exert a synergistic anti-fibrotic effect. These findings suggest that the effective components in CR may represent a new approach for IPF treatment."
"Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a progressive and fatal chronic disease. One of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved therapies for IPF, oral pirfenidone (PFD), has limited clinical applications owing to its systemic side effects. In contrast to oral administration, inhaled therapy offers enhanced therapeutic efficacy at the target organ while minimizing systemic side effects. However, its application has challenges, such as limited drug delivery to the distal lung region and rapid clearance. In this study, we developed pulmonary surfactant (PS)-based PFD-loaded nanovesicles (PFD-PSNVs) for targeted delivery to the lung area and prolonged retention and examined their safety, stability, and antifibrotic efficacy. PFD-PSNVs were prepared using the thin-film hydration and extrusion method. The mean size and zeta potential of PFD-PSNVs were 149.7 ± 10.1 nm and - 31.3 ± 2.3 mV, respectively. An in vitro antifibrotic study showed that PFD-PSNVs inhibited the expression of fibrotic factors such as p-ERK, p-SMAD2/3, and α-SMA proteins on fibroblasts activated by transforming growth factor-β1. When inhaled in mice using a nebulizer, the PFD-PSNVs remained in lung tissues for 24 h, whereas Arikayce, an FDA-approved liposomal formulation for inhalation, was eliminated within 6 h. In a bleomycin sulfate-induced IPF mouse model, inhalation treatment with PFD-PSNVs significantly reduced collagen deposition (76.2 ± 4.1 %, p < 0.01) and α-SMA expression (60.8 ± 3.7 %, p < 0.05) compared with inhalation treatment with the PFD-loaded CtrlNV (PFD-CNVs) formulation and oral administration of PFD. These results indicate that PSNVs have great potential as an inhaled drug delivery system for the treatment of IPF."
"The term progressive pulmonary fibrosis (PPF) refers to a specific disorder that becomes worse despite optimal treatment. The pathogenic explanation of this progressive worsening is still to be found. In this study, we explored whether any histological, molecular, radiological, or clinical features could predict a progressive phenotype in patients with fibrotic interstitial lung diseases. Two hundred and fifteen patients with PPF other than idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) and connective tissue disease-associated ILD (CTD-ILD) were followed in our ILD clinic between January 2016 and May 2023. Based on tissue block availability, 48 patients were definitively enrolled. Progression was defined according to the most recent guidelines. Clinical, radiological, and functional data were also collected retrospectively and correlated with tissue morphological and molecular cytokine profiles. Fifteen patients were classified as progressors (PPF) and 33 as non-progressors (nPPF) with similar age at diagnosis and gender. PPF showed a higher prevalence of traction bronchiectasis (80% vs. 27%; p=<0.001) at CT scan and lower functional parameters [FVC: 2.42 L vs. 3.37 L; p=0.004; TLC: 3.83 L vs. 4.65 L; p=0.027] at diagnosis. Lung specimens revealed a significant overexpression of IL9 in the PPF compared to the nPPF group (p=0.049). Boruta algorithm analysis showed that lymphoid aggregates and traction bronchiectasis at diagnosis are the most important variables in determining the PPF status. The present results increase the understanding of the pathological mechanisms of PPF, offering potential avenues for improved prognostication and therapeutic intervention."
"Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a chronic, progressive interstitial lung disease characterized by excessive extracellular matrix (ECM) deposition and irreversible lung damage. A key driver of disease progression is the phenotypic shift of lipofibroblasts (LIFs) into activated myofibroblasts (aMYFs), triggered by sustained epithelial injury, caused by inflammation, oxidative stress, viral infections (e.g., influenza, SARS-CoV-2), and metabolic dysfunction. Emerging evidence demonstrates that this transition is reversible, with pharmacological agents that promote aMYF-to-LIF reprogramming contributing to fibrosis resolution. The identification of inflammatory lipofibroblasts (iLIFs) highlights the importance of inflammation in fibrosis progression. Inflammation, mediated by IL-1β, IL-17A, and TGF- β, sustain aMYF activation, while immune cells shape fibrosis formation. This review combines current insights on the cellular and molecular pathways controlling fibroblast differentiation, highlighting key metabolic, immunologic, and oxidative stress-modulating targets for therapeutic intervention. Understanding and manipulating the LIF-iLIF-aMYF axis offers a promising strategy for reversing fibrosis and restoring pulmonary homeostasis in IPF."
"Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis (IPF) is a chronic, progressive lung disorder characterized by excessive fibrosis and structural remodeling of lung tissue. The role of inflammation in developing and progressing IPF is increasingly recognized as critical. However, the precise mechanisms and pathways of inflammation in IPF remain unclear. This study aimed to identify inflammation-related genes in IPF and develop a prognostic risk model using machine learning approaches. The IPF dataset GSE70866 from the Gene Expression Omnibus database was analyzed to identify inflammation-related genes. Unsupervised clustering algorithms were used to classify IPF samples, followed by weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) to identify highly correlated genes. Least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression was then applied, and the intersection of results pinpointed critical hub genes, primarily <i>CCL2</i> and <i>STAB1</i>. A rat model of pulmonary fibrosis was established, and lentivirus transfection was used to knock down <i>CCL2</i> expression. The transfection effect and hub gene expression were validated using Quantitative polymerase chain reaction, Western blot, immunohistochemistry, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, hematoxylin-eosin staining, and Masson's trichrome staining. Levels of α-SMA and COL1A1 were also assessed. WGCNA and LASSO regression analyses identified <i>CCL2</i> and <i>STAB1</i> as significant contributors to IPF, closely associated with patient prognosis and immune cell infiltration. Protein-protein interaction network analysis established <i>CCL2</i> as a novel biomarker for IPF. In a rat model of IPF, <i>CCL2</i> expression was significantly elevated compared to that in the controls. Knockdown of <i>CCL2</i> expression alleviated pulmonary fibrosis and reduced the expression of COL1A1 protein and α-SMA protein. <i>CCL2</i> promotes the expression of COL1A1 protein and α-SMA proteins, suggesting that the mechanism of inflammation-induced pulmonary fibrosis may involve the regulation of COL1A1 and α-SMA by <i>CCL2</i>. These findings establish <i>CCL2</i> as a promising biomarker and potential therapeutic target for IPF."
"Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a progressive incurable lung disease characterized by chronic inflammation and fibrosis, with innate immune cells such as neutrophils and macrophages playing central roles in its pathogenesis. This review explores the involvement of these immune cells in the inflammatory process of IPF, focusing on their contribution to disrupted tissue repair and impaired resolution. The balance between host defense mechanisms, including leukocyte recruitment, and the release of proresolving mediators is crucial for maintaining healthy tissue function and returning to preinflammatory states. We highlight the importance of inflammation resolution to prevent an overactive immune response, which can lead to irreversible fibrosis. Specialized proresolving mediators, including lipoxins, resolvins, protectins, and maresins, are discussed in terms of their regulatory effects on neutrophils and macrophages in IPF. These mediators exhibit potent anti-inflammatory actions, which can modulate the immune response and promote the resolution of inflammation. Overall, this review underscores the significance of immune modulation in IPF, with a focus on the therapeutic potential of specialized proresolving mediators in controlling the inflammatory response and preventing fibrosis progression. Future research into the antifibrotic properties of SPMs and their impact on innate immune cell regulation holds promise for novel therapeutic strategies in IPF treatment."
"Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is an unexplained interstitial lung disease in which senescence is a central risk factor. Senescent cells drive chronic inflammation and fibrosis by the secreting senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP). Interleukin-11 (IL-11), a core factor in the SASP, is significantly upregulated in IPF lung tissues.IL-11 promotes lung cellular senescence and chronic inflammation through the activation of the JAK2/STAT3 and MEK/ERK1/2 pathways. It also leads to extracellular matrix protein deposition by promoting fibroblast-myofibroblast transformation, epithelial mesenchymal transition and endothelial mesenchymal transition. Targeting IL-11 has antiaging and fibrotic effects. Nanoparticle delivery therapeutic regimens targeting IL-11 show potential in animal models of IPF, but evidence for their clinical application is lacking. Future studies should focus on the dynamic molecular regulatory mechanisms of IL-11 in IPF, as well as the development of targeted delivery systems and multitarget combined intervention therapeutic regimens. This review systematically analyzes the molecular mechanisms of IL-11 in IPF and provides new perspectives for the treatment of aging-associated pulmonary fibrosis."
"Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a progressive interstitial lung disease with a highly variable clinical course. Forced vital capacity (FVC) is widely used as a marker of disease severity and progression, yet its variability and dependence on patient effort raise concerns regarding its reliability. Given these limitations, we investigated the clinical significance of slow vital capacity (SVC) as a potential alternative measure of lung function in IPF.In a retrospective cohort of 89 IPF patients who underwent pulmonary function testing with concomitant SVC measurements, we observed a strong correlation between FVC and SVC (r = 0.973 at baseline, r = 0.978 at follow-up). However, in 99% of cases, SVC values were equal to or exceeded FVC, and follow-up assessments revealed that FVC exhibited greater variability than SVC. Notably, patients with a decrease in SVC demonstrated worse survival outcomes, whereas FVC decline did not show the same prognostic significance. These findings suggest that SVC may provide a more stable and clinically meaningful measure of disease progression in IPF. Moreover, its less effort-dependent nature could improve reproducibility, particularly in patients with advanced diseases.Our study highlights the potential role of SVC as a valuable metric in clinical practice and as an endpoint in future IPF trials. Prospective validation of these findings could further establish SVC as a superior tool for disease monitoring and therapeutic assessment."
"Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a relentlessly progressive and fatal disease with few effective therapies available. Fibrosis is driven, in part, by cell-state transitions of epithelial progenitors within the airways that repopulate the injured alveoli. This alveolar atypia affects gas exchange and stimulates ECM production. We sought to examine the role of BRD4 signaling in progenitor expansion in bleomycin-induced lung injury. Activation of the Bromodomain-containing protein 4 (BRD4) epigenetic regulator in distinct stem cell populations was quantitated in a high-resolution scRNA-seq time course of bleomycin-induced injury, and confirmed in scRNA-seq studies in human IPF. A potent, selective, and orally bioavailable BRD4 inhibitor (BRD4i, ZL0969) was rationally designed and synthesized. The effect of BRD4i on myofibroblast transition, progenitor cell expansion and fibrosis was evaluated using a therapeutic experimental design in C57BL6/mice. We find that the BRD4 pathway is rapidly induced in regenerating activated alveolar type (AT)2 cells and persists in a population of pro-fibrotic Krt8 + progenitors expressing markers of epithelial mesenchymal transition as well as senescence. To test the functional role of BRD4 activation, we administered a potent, selective, and orally bioavailable BRD4 inhibitor (BRD4i, ZL0969) with ~ 80 nM IC<sub>50</sub> to bleomycin-treated mice. BRD4i reduced myofibroblast formation and deposition of denatured ECM (collagen and laminin a1) in the alveolar space and improved disease scores. Importantly, BRD4i reduced a pathogenic population of alveolar progenitor cells expressing integrin (ITG)-A6/B4, tumor related protein 63 (Trp63) and keratin (Krt). In mice given an LD<sub>50</sub> dose of bleomycin, BRD4 inhibition significantly improved their survival and reduced markers of disease. These data demonstrate that inhibition of BRD4 signaling prevents expansion of myofibroblasts and expansion of a pathogenic epithelial progenitor population controlling alveolar atypia and fibrosis."
"Transcriptome profiling by RNA sequencing (RNAseq) can provide insightful information on the molecular processes underlying disease development and progression. Although fresh tissue represents the preferred source material for RNAseq, here, we investigated the feasibility of applying RNAseq analysis to single 10 μm thick formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded (FFPE) lung slides from the lungs of control and bleomycin (BLM)-treated mice. This approach aims at providing spatial-oriented transcriptomic data, that can be integrated with in vivo and ex vivo readouts obtained on the same sample, as a way to enhance the mechanistic information and biomarker/target discovery potential of preclinical models of fibrotic lung diseases. RNAseq analysis was conducted on individual FFPE slides from the lungs of both controls and BLM-treated mice. The results were initially validated by comparison with publicly available bulk data from fresh-frozen (FF) mouse tissues, both untreated and BLM-treated, as well as human idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) biopsies. Unsupervised cluster analysis was performed on Differentially Expressed Genes (DEGs) distinguishing untreated and BLM-treated fibrotic lung samples. For each sample, Pearson correlation analysis was used to compare expression levels of individual gene clusters with Ashcroft Scores and aeration compartments quantitatively assessed on the matched 2D micro-CT coronal slice. Over 90% of annotated genes within the FFPE dataset were shared with gene signatures retrieved from FF bulk datasets. Differentially modulated gene clusters were mainly found to be associated with extracellular matrix (ECM) organization, tissue remodeling, and inflammatory response pathways. For each sample, expression levels of individual gene clusters were highly correlated with 2D histology readouts and aeration compartments determined on matched 2D coronal slices by micro-CT imaging. FFPE lung tissue represents a valuable alternative to fresh tissue for RNAseq analysis, allowing to achieve a more precise, spatially oriented picture of pulmonary disease development. This approach is thus instrumental to a better characterization of the molecular changes associated to each sample. It can also contribute to a more informed interpretation of histology and micro-CT imaging data, paving the way to the identification of translationally relevant biomarkers as well as novel candidate targets for the development of more effective therapeutic interventions."
"Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a rare, progressive, and fibrotic disease with poor prognosis that lacks treatment options. As a major component of the lung adaptive immune system, plasma cells play a crucial regulatory role during fibrosis. The aim of this study is to systematically explore plasma cells-related genes associated with prognosis in patients with IPF. The marker genes for plasma cells were extracted via single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) analysis. Hub genes most relevant to the IPF state and plasma cells infiltration level were screened by weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA). Moreover, the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were obtained based on the bulk RNA-seq and microarray data. In addition, a machine learning-based integrative procedure for constructing a concordance plasma cells-related gene signature (PCRGS) was developed. A core gene in the PCRGS was further identified and validated through experiments. Finally, the network pharmacology analysis for the core gene was implemented. The established PCRGS, based on the seven genes (SLAMF7, JCHAIN, PNOC, POU2AF1, MEI1, ST6GAL1, and VOPP1), was identified as an independent prognostic factor for overall survival. It also demonstrated well robustness compared to conventional clinical features and 22 published signatures. Eventually, ST6GAL1 was selected as the core gene and its localization in the plasma cells as well as its over-expression in the lungs of bleomycin-injured mice was experimentally validated. The small molecular drugs prediction and docking analysis suggest quercetin as the optimal ligand targeting ST6GAL1 which might form a stable binding conformation with it. PCRGS might be used to evaluate the IPF prognosis, among which ST6GAL1 is a potential therapeutic target. These results provide an important basis for future studies on the relationship between plasma cells-related genes and IPF."
"To explore the therapeutic effects of Nobiletin (NOB) on Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) and to identify its targets and molecular pathways. We verified the inhibitory effect of NOB on the senescence of A549 cells through in vitro experiments, and the inhibitory effect of NOB on the migration ability of fibroblasts was verified by the Transwell experiment. The inhibitory effects of NOB on Idiopathic IPF were subsequently assessed in a mouse model induced by bleomycin (BLM). Through PPI network, gene ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) enrichment analysis, the PI3K/AKT/MDM2/p53 signaling pathway was identified as the critical pathway. The key proteins in the signaling pathway were verified by molecular docking and western blotting. NOB showed a great inhibitory effect on A549 cell senescence and Fibroblast migration. Meanwhile, NOB reduced BLM-induced collagen deposition in mouse lung tissues and inhibited alveolar epithelial cell (AEC) senescence. Through PPI network, P53 was screened as a core target of NOB. According to functional enrichment analysis results, the PI3K/AKT signaling was believed to have played an important role. Therefore, we speculate that the PI3K/AKT/MDM2/p53 signaling pathway mediated NOB's impact on IPF. These findings were validated through molecular docking and western blotting. This study demonstrated that NOB suppressed cell senescence to protect IPF through mediating the PI3K/AKT/MDM2/p53 signaling pathway."
"Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a progressive lung disease characterized by excessive macrophage infiltration and extracellular matrix deposition. The progress of IPF is promoted by M2 macrophages which produce pro-fibrotic factors and induce fibroblast differentiation. SESN3 was upregulated in lung tissues of IPF patients and mice with bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis. However, the role of SESN3 in IPF and its related mechanisms remain largely unknown. Here, we used IL-4/13 to induce macrophage M2 polarization in RAW264.7 cells and constructed a mouse model of pulmonary fibrosis by intratracheal injection of bleomycin. Adenoviruses targeting SESN3 were constructed to infect RAW264.7 cells and BLM-induced mice to assess the function of SESN3 in macrophage M2 polarization in the progress of IPF and mRNA-seq and Co-IP-MS analysis were performed to find the downstream factors. For in vitro experiments, SESN3 knockdown promoted the M2 polarization level, the release of pro-fibrosis factors and the activation of fibroblast, overexpression of SESN3 had an opposite trend. For in vivo experiments, the increased degree of pulmonary fibrosis in BLM mice was relieved after overexpression of SESN3. Meanwhile, overexpression of SESN3 repressed the increased macrophage M2 polarization level induced by BLM. Mechanically, FOSL2 was screened out through mRNA-seq and Co-IP-MS analysis due to its binding affinity with SESN3 and the observed downregulation of its downstream pro-fibrotic factor expression. The expression of FOSL2 in the nucleus was down-regulated after SESN3 overexpression. Under IL-4/13 treatment, the increased levels of macrophage M2 polarization and pro-fibrotic factors induced by SESN3 knockdown was recovered after knocking down FOSL2 in RAW264.7 cells. In summary, our study suggested that SESN3 regulated the IPF process through inhibiting macrophage M2 polarization by targeting the activity of FOSL2."
"Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is an age-related disease with an unclear pathogenesis. The senescence and insufficient regeneration of alveolar epithelial cells are significant factors in the development and progression of IPF. Currently, effective treatment methods are lacking. The aim of this study is to explore the mechanism of action of uridine in delaying the aging of AECs and intervening in IPF. In vitro, Western blot and qRT-PCR analyzed uridine's effects on bleomycin-induced senescence, EMT, cell viability, and cell cycle. In vivo, uridine's impact on lung aging and fibrosis in BLM-induced mice was assessed by weight, staining, Ashcroft scoring, and Western blot. Uridine reduced senescence markers in A549 cells, suppressed epithelial-mesenchymal transition, improved antioxidant capacity, and delayed pulmonary fibrosis and lung aging in mice. The effects of uridine were mediated through the NRF2 signaling pathway, which regulates antioxidant defense and autophagy. Uridine enhanced autophagic degradation of Keap1, possibly through p62/SQSTM1-mediated autophagy. These findings suggest that uridine inhibits AEC senescence via the NRF2 pathway, mitigating IPF progression and offering a potential strategy for treating age-related pulmonary fibrosis by targeting oxidative stress."
